2,"I am fine with creating a podman group and adding write access to the socket, but not by default,  This would have to be configured in the containers.conf with strong words about how dangerous this is.  

Setting up podman group access to the root running podman, is equivalent to giving sudo without password access to root, and potentially worse.

Is there something we could do as an alternative with systemd?  IE I turn on the systemd podman.sock socket for a particular user and it sets up permissions for just this user. 
Bottom line, I would want this to be specific to the remote service over ssh rather then something local users of a linux system start doing.","['local', 'linux', 'access']","systemd

3,"> I understood that to mean that the CoreDNS pods were being restarted (rolled out) at the annotations, not the application pods.

You are correct @chrisohaver, I'm talking about the `coredns pods` and **not about** the `application pods` when I mentioned about restarts and rollouts.

> Oh, we should check that with the reporter. Restarting the CoreDNS pods will fix the issue in this ticket too as it's CoreDNS pods (some, not usually all, but can be all) that are in a bad state, so restarting CoreDNS also fixes the issue. But... the distinct thing about this ticket is that restarting the app pods also fixes the issue. We should have the reporter check if some of their app pods have the issue and if deleting those app pods causes the issue to go away.

@huntharo I can easily do this and return with some results!

Also, we are currently running the v1.7.0 under our staging environment, I will keep you guys posted.","['environment', 'app', 'distinct', 'go', 'coredns']","pods

4,"I can't believe this is still an open issue. Seems like a very obvious feature for TypeScript. Can't wait to see it!

I personally prefer `catch(error as Error)` as opposed to `catch(error: Error)` because the first makes more sense because you're casting and faking it, but if we used the second method then people may mistakenly believe we are telling the try-catch block to behave in a certain way which is not what TypeScript is for. That should be a new JavaScript feature.

Still, @zzzzBov did show an interesting way of getting around this which is something I'm completely up for.","['typescript', 'block']","typescript

I looked through a bunch of the changed test baselines last week, and my suspicion is that this change is going to be too big for 4.0 now that we’ve released the beta (we try not to add any big features or breaking changes during this period).

10,"I agree safety is the most important - it's the main reason I want to use structs :) Even `printStackTrace` has the caveat that ""The format of this information depends on the implementation"", and there has indeed been a significant format change with Java 7. Having parsing fail because a backend didn't catch up with a Java or Android version seems fragile and with a higher chance of failure, admittedly it's not something that happens often but there's no guarantee of safety here. This is just one programming language, others may take even less care with stack trace strings, but the native APIs of the languages don't have this issue.

I appreciate the concern about the missing checks / features in our reference implementations. But I don't think that's a reason to assume we can't get it right - we're doing a good job of learning from prior art and going through the details. Serializing a stack isn't such a complex issue that this is untenable, and once we have it down right it should be forwards compatible through any changes in the runtime, I don't see a big reason to expect our code to be less safe than a runtime.

> I'm still trying to compare the CPU and memory allocation cost of recording structured stacks as compared to using a string encoding. 

I spiked a change to marshall exceptions into the proto and compare with string. 

https://github.com/anuraaga/opentelemetry-java/blob/exception-serialize/exporters/otlp/src/jmh/java/io/opentelemetry/trace/ExceptionDescriptionBenchmark.java
https://gist.github.com/anuraaga/4e6f09408392264fedbfc13c98f2d3f8
(note the proto change is in the gist itself in case anyone wants to compile themselves, since it'd be tedious to propagate that through submodules in a way that can be pushed)

As with all benchmarks, there's always a chance it's missing something, happy to adjust with any feedback. FWIW, I tried a default `StringWriter` before and tried changing to presized `StringBuilder` wrapped with writer, but didn't see any real difference.

From the numbers, it seems that proto is a little faster, maybe due to the reduced amount of whitespace / words like `At:`. But even with 150 stack frames, both are <50us - don't know what people's thresholds are but this seems low enough not to worry too much about to me. Of course, this is only Java, but I figure other languages like Go would be at least as fast.

One thing I noticed with `MaxJavaStackTraceDepth` is it affects population of stack trace, not printing, so the flag affects both approaches the same. If we wanted to use `printStackTrace` with our own limit on depth, I can't think of a way other than a line-length-limited `PrintWriter` which still has to iterate the entire stack either way.

Let me know if any other info can help here (though I can't commit to writing similar code in other languages).","['cpu', 'android', 'population', 'frames', 'compare', 'ignore', 'format', 'java', 'memory', 'native', 'depends', 'allocation', 'ca', 'iterate', 'printwriter']","stack

20,"@cpakulski maybe we should reconsider `enable_parsing` to be `false` by default due to the poor quality of the current SQL parser. Below I'll show you some concrete information about why we should reconsider it:

Did some tests using the [pgbench](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/pgbench.html) tool to simulate a workload and used the three available modes of protocol: `simple`, `extended` and `prepared`.

1. **simple** protocol:

    ```text
    ...
    postgres.egress_postgres.statements: 257447
    ...
    postgres.egress_postgres.statements_parse_error: 110334
    postgres.egress_postgres.statements_parsed: 147113
    ...
    ```

2. **extended** protocol:

    ```text
    postgres.egress_postgres.statements: 135549
    ...
    postgres.egress_postgres.statements_parse_error: 135548
    postgres.egress_postgres.statements_parsed: 1
    ```

3. **prepared** protocol:

    ```text
    postgres.egress_postgres.statements: 146742
    ...
    postgres.egress_postgres.statements_parse_error: 70
    postgres.egress_postgres.statements_parsed: 1
    ```

And running PostgreSQL regression tests trough Envoy we get ~70% of queries not parsed (all regression runs in Simple mode)

```text
postgres.egress_postgres.statements_parse_error: 25852
postgres.egress_postgres.statements_parsed: 11377
```
 
Another evidence of the low effectiveness of this feature due the parser limitation is demonstrated on the table below. I collected information about a lot of Postgres connectors implementations in several programming languages and the majority of the cases the default mode is `Extended`:

I assume that for a pytorch update, say from 1.2 to 1.3 there will be updates related to the operations, and enable the operation, the team has to come up with different solution for different cuda version? As I know there will be some lib difference between different version of CUDA

I'm new to ML and I just approached PyTorch (coming from a short beginning with TensorFlow).

I'm currently having fun with this repo [https://github.com/mar-muel/artificial-self-AMLD-2020/blob/master/3/task\_3.ipynb](https://github.com/mar-muel/artificial-self-AMLD-2020/blob/master/3/task_3.ipynb) that creates sort of like a chatbot trained on chat logs. I followed the Colab and I ended up saving the mode on my drive. 

I know it's probably a stupid question, but I'm now struggling to run the model I previously saved locally on my machine. Any suggestions on how to do it? And what about recalling it in a colab?

At the moment this is what I did (on colab) after copying the model from my drive to a `runs` folder inside of `/content/artificial-self-AMLD-2020/3` :

    !git clone https://github.com/mar-muel/artificial-self-AMLD-2020.git
    %cd /content/artificial-self-AMLD-2020/3

But I'm far from getting the logic here, and of course is not working.

I've got the **Xfinity X1 modem/route**r.  The house is run with CAT5 and coax and wifi and everything works great. **The cable boxes, 8 or 9 of them I suppose, all come into the MoCA port on the modem** via one coax.

I installed a Unifi USG router/firewall, so I want to enable bridge mode (deactivate routing and DHCP) in the Xfinity modem/router.  This works great, except it kills the MoCA network served by the Xfinity modem and thus all the cable boxes.  I've seen many posts asking about the same sort of issue, but no answers...

**Is it possible** to have that single coax cable- that splits out to all the cable boxes- plugged into my network BEHIND the USG? ideally via a single adapter plugged into my ethernet switch..   *(I thought about splitter/amplifier problems, etc, but it all it worked fine when plugged in to the MoCA port on the modem, so i think the coax wiring is fine.)*  I ordered a single adapter on Amazon ""Actiontec/TiVo MOCA Adapter for Ethernet Over Coax, 1 Gbps Bonded 2.0 MoCA Adapter (ECB6200) Pack of 1"" and did not have any luck.

Any suggestions? Are there forwarding rules or ports or any other kind of setup I need to do in the USG firewall?

55,"Transposing in Linear Regression. I am trying to change the (w \* x\^t + b) in this code to the more traditional (w\^t \* x + b) form.

    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np
    
    x_data = np.random.rand(2000,3) 
    w_real = [0.3,0.5,0.1]
    b_real = -0.2
    
    noise = np.random.randn(1,2000)*0.1
    y_data = np.matmul(w_real,x_data.T) + b_real + noise
    
    NUM_STEPS = 10
    
    g = tf.Graph()
    wb_ = []
    with g.as_default():
        x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32,shape=[None,3])
        y_true = tf.placeholder(tf.float32,shape=None)
    
        with tf.name_scope('inference') as scope:
            w = tf.Variable([[0,0,0]],dtype=tf.float32,name='weights')
            b = tf.Variable(0,dtype=tf.float32,name='bias')
            # Here w is initialized as a row vector; It works in this case because
            # transposing x will yield the same result as in the traditional equation (wt * x + b)
    
            y_pred = tf.matmul(w,tf.transpose(x)) + b
    
        with tf.name_scope('loss') as scope:
            loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true-y_pred))
    
        with tf.name_scope('train') as scope:
            learning_rate = 0.05
            optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate)
            train = optimizer.minimize(loss)
    
        #before starting, initialize the variables. We will 'run' this first.
        init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            sess.run(init)
            for step in range(NUM_STEPS):
                sess.run(train,{x: x_data, y_true: y_data})
                if (step % 5 == 0):
                    print(step, sess.run([w,b]))
                    wb_.append(sess.run([w,b]))
    
            print(10, sess.run([w,b]))

I was given the hint that changes need to be made somewhere within these lines of code, as well as a rule that we COULD NOT change line 5.

    x_data = np.random.rand(2000,3) 
    
    x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32,shape=[None,3])
    y_true = tf.placeholder(tf.float32,shape=None)
    
    w = tf.Variable([[0,0,0]],dtype=tf.float32,name='weights')
    b = tf.Variable(0,dtype=tf.float32,name='bias')

I attempted to change the code to the (w^(t) \* x + b) form and then work with the error codes until I got it working, however I kept running into circular problems where changing the shapes would only bring up different issues.

Note: This is ran using Tensorflow 1.15","['minimize', 'import', 'placeholder', 'graph', 'append', 'global', 'loss', 'np', 'equation', 'tensorflow', 'noise', 'random', 'numpy', 'x', 'init', 'range', 'initializer', 'form']","tf

I feel like it's because it's doing it through https and not http, but why would it be a 404 error? Wouldn't it be a different one?

59,"Flutter and AWS. Hey everyone, how's it going?

Some background: I'm an intern in a small software company and the owners are willing to launch new products with a more up-to-date tech stack (nowadays we pretty much have one major client only,). My boss asked me to do some research and I think using Flutter with AWS serverless would be a good shot.

I'm new to both Flutter and AWS , and I wanna make a very simple app in order to learn the basics on how to integrate AWS to the application. Basically it'd be a ""hello world"" app, in which the user inputs their name, taps a button and it outputs ""hello, name"" and then stores the name of the person in an AWS database (dynamoDB). So the ""architecture"" would be something like:

Flutter app as the front-end — calls API Gateway — calls Lambda Function — stores names in DynamoDB.

So I have two questions:

1. does that architecture even make sense? is it possible to work with it? if so, does anybody have any feedback on it?
2. How would I go about actually doing the integration between the Flutter front-end and API Gateway + Lambda? I have done some AWS tutorials but I feel like they weren't really helpful for what I wanna do.

Thank you very much sorry if these are too simple questions i'm really new to serverless",[],"aws

A new SSD &amp; Battery/Charger was required for the 2013 MBP retina 13"" I purchased. I got the battery kit from [ifixit.com](https://ifixit.com). I got the OWC aura x2 Pro 240gb SSD. I thought I'd internet recover the latest OS by holding OPTION+COMMAND+R, but it didn't work. 

The Mac said no disk was detectable, so in all my ignorance, my two questions are:

1. How do I download Mac OS Catalina, using Ubuntu, onto a Flash Drive?
2. How will the mac detect the disk (SSD)?

As an admin for Honeycomb Pollinators, we wanted to let you know about a new feature designed to help more users on your team to stay on top of their calendar right from Slack.

*How it works:*
- G Suite administrators can now perform a <https://support.google.com/a/answer/172482?hl=en|domain wide install> of the Google Calendar app in any workspace where the app is installed in Slack.
- As an admin, you’re granting permission to the Google Calendar app in Slack on behalf of members on your team. This means that each individual in your workspace will have their account automatically connected to the app so they don’t need to complete the permissions process on their own. 
- After the domain wide auth is deployed, each person in your workspace can set personal preferences—like configuring notifications and syncing their status—or choose to disconnect their calendar from the app.

*Get started* by visiting the Settings button in your calendar's <slack://app?team=T4T3A2T63&amp;id=ADZ494LHY&amp;tab=home|home tab>

68,"Hi again.  Our current design calls for tail-sampling of events.  I’ve been looking at blog posts, etc. on the Honeycomb website and unless I’ve missed stuff, it appears that that the sampling strategies (at least for a JVM server) are “roll your own” in the sense that while the Honeycomb Java library (which we’re not currently using anyways) gives a way to tag each event with a sample rate, it’s up to the service developers to do anything higher-level than that.

So I was wondering if there’s been anything new in that space since those posts were written last year (or earlier) and/or what your customers who do tail sampling generally do.  For example, have people used the OpenTelemetry collector (which I think has some tail-sampling capability) as an intermediary?",[],"sampling

The external client would be sending any spans it creates to HC via an ingest service we’d have which would “forward” them to HC (so clients would *not* be directly talking to HC).

Something like that brings up the possibility of time/timestamp skew between the external clients and the cloud services. So we were curious about any recommendations you might have on reconciling received timestamps with the cloud services’ idea of time.",[],"external

73,"Just a quick heads up to Nathan (not anchoring here cos TZ lag ^^) about the deployment model; We have changed, we won't be deploying OC service  (agent and collector). We can be way faster by;
1) adding HC exporter to price-service (golang application) its actually 98% done :blob-bee:
2) deploying honeycomb-opentracing-proxy to ingest tracing data from api-v2 (php application)

*Why?*
1)  That would require us to remove the prometheus and jaeger exporters from the code, and let the new OC collector export them out. The problem is price-service is a critical service and we can break its traces or metrics by moving them to collector, we don't need to spent time with that for the POC, thx for OC exporters
2) Api-v2 is the most critical service we have, it serves ~90% of HelloFresh customers queries. If we go with OC service, the way OC php SDK works with OC service is by adding a additional daemon process (traces are exported via local unix socket) at the same container. ATM the api-v2 processes already take high cpu times :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes_and_hand_covering_mouth:, its too risky for the POC purposes I'd say.

lemme know what you think about that, thank you ^^","['model', 'honeycomb.io', 'deploying', 'opentracing', 'honeycombio', 'api', 'php', 'export', 'deployment', 'proxy', 'honeycomb', 'go', 'sdk', 'blob']","oc

Regarding automation, here's what I can share:
• Datasets - these are automatically created upon receipt of data marked with a new dataset name. That way you can even create datasets with curl. However there's no API for management of them.
• Team members: You aready have SAML enabled and all users signing up via SAML, so they will be automatically added to your team 
• boards - yes! there is a Boards API: <https://docs.honeycomb.io/api/boards-api/#docs-sidebar>
• SLOs - not yet.  However I recommend you watch our new 3-part video series on SLOs, these have a lot of practical advice I think you'll find valuable: <https://www.honeycomb.io/production-slos/>
• Finally, one more bit of automation that is very popular and useful is to use Markers.  For example all code deploys, config changes and alerts from other systems could be added as markers to dataset: <https://docs.honeycomb.io/api/markers/>",[],"boards

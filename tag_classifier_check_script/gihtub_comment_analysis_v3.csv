With regard to any form of enforcement clause: this is different in kind than the rest of the statement – it is less universal.  As different projects have different enforcement needs, defining that policy here will tend to limit uptake of the CoC.

With regard to the current specific enforcement clause, it is probably too vague. Legal documents are not really English or (choose your favorite language), though they appear to be.  They are more like code, and the legal system is the compiler.

Laying out a process of termination definitely steps into the territory of legalities, but the compiler tends to choke on anything not written by a lawyer.  For example, under US law, a person has certain inherent due-process rights.  If an enforcement process abrogates those rights, then the enforcement clause may be unenforceable.  And if one clause in a document is bad, then the whole document may be void unless something called a ""severability clause"" was included.

You would have to get a lawyer to explain the whole can of worms; I only know that it is a can of worms.  Without an enforcement clause, I believe it is clear that contributors serve ""at the pleasure of"" the project leader/s.

However, the information is no longer private if the contribution was published online publicly by its author. A github PR is an example of something published online publicly.

For contributions sent privately, the maintainer has a CoC obligation to ask first.

It's still up to the maintainer to be certain that all their contributors understand the license they applied and the CoC they agreed to, so perhaps it is wisest to ask them up front or even each time. You could use a CLA for that if you must.

I think there's a misunderstanding here that might be based in the fact that there's nuance to this statement in the covenant that requires some knowledge of harassment techniques online.

When harassing a person, it is common to ""dox"" them by obtaining addresses (physical or electronic), government issued identification numbers (Social Security Numbers, etc.), and information about the target's family online. This is what the covenant refers to, not the overly-literal interpretation you provide.

Self-deprecation is one form of humor and one that the author/creator owns. I don't see how this would cause someone else to have to modify that copyright statement. Since copyright statements are not modified, it should be rather clear who wrote that and it would be clear that this was not an insult.

You seem to also be unfamiliar with how people engaging in harassment tend to bombard a target with comments on their personal appearance to cause them emotional harm.

> Have you considered the potential incompatibilities between the code of conduct and free software licensing?

34,"""With regard to"" is difficult to understand too. Simpler language would be better.

Is ""will"" enough to express the ethical obligation? It is certainly good for expressing the will to maintain confidentiality of course. We're choosing to impose this duty on ourselves, we're not being forced to do so. As I understand it.

May I suggest the following rewrite, assuming it keeps the spirit of the original?

> The project team <del>is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.</del>
> The project team <ins>will keep information about incident reporters confidential, as an ethical duty.</ins>

That knocks out the clumsier ""is obligated to"" ... ""with regard to"" lawyerese. It also makes clearer what is being talked about (your information, in our hands).

Some people think ""obligated"" is an ugly word, and that ""obliged"" has an identical meaning. Yet the meanings seem to be drifting: http://grammarist.com/usage/obliged-vs-obligated/

That said, I think ""duty"" serves, unless there is an actual legal requirement. And it sidesteps the argument.

Though I don't like the dangling ""as an ethical duty"", for what it's worth. Is there a better way of conveying that?

Asides:

Shouldn't the confidential treatment of data extend to the data which is gathered about identified parties, especially identified victims?

Perhaps the CoC should also state when confidential information might be shared (specified trusted third parties, on a strict need to know basis, for legal reasons only?). But that's getting ahead of ourselves.
",['shared']
35,"Thanks for your quick reply!

I agree with with what you say, however the wording of the CoC does not currently seem to reflect this, as I read: ""Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include.... The use of sexualized language or imagery""

This reads as a explicit blanket ban on the use of sexual content, which I feel is a major problem and goes beyond the intended scope of the CoC (i.e. preventing harassment). 

It would be far better if the CoC made it clear that _appropriate_ use of sexual content is acceptable. I don't think the discretion of project maintainers is sufficient here (since they would have to go against the explicit wording of the CoC), and I also wouldn't want to encourage people to add exception / disclaimers / clarifying provisions (otherwise what is the point of encouraging a standardised CoC?)

36,"I appreciate you reaching out with these concerns, but I think that there is a clear difference between the contexts that you are pointing out and the intent of the language in the code of conduct.

38,"@davidcelis I think the part of the CoC you're referring to makes explicit the powers of project maintainers that everyone already knew that they had.  That is to say, if you troll the heck out of any project, you're gonna get thrown out.  The CoC is a covenant (hence the name) wherein maintainers _further_ make explicit their intent to use their powers to further prevent the behavior defined in the document.  The responsibility ultimately rests with maintainers to identify infractions, respond to them, and come to a resolution in a way that fits their community and the CoC.  I think that it's a bit of FUD that promotes the idea that the CoC is the first and last stop for marginalizing some group of people and kicking them out of the project for not engaging in some kind of groupthink.

As far as penalties and bans go, I think this process is something that is best defined by an adopting community of the CoC.  Processes where significant offenders rehabilitate and are brought back into the fold are complicated and expensive (but they can be worth it, too!).  Communities have limited resources and time.  I think it follows that communities that want to employ procedure in this area need to figure out what works for them and implement it themselves (and add it to their fork of the CoC).  It's hard to identify a good one-size-fits-all approach a priori, but it may be possible that a successful process can be derived from many different communities in the future.
",['go']
39,"@seniorwrangler For something like this you're probably best off forking the CoC and replacing the clause with 'unwelcome sexual advances'. Judging what is 'appropriate' and 'inappropriate' language is still maintainer's discretion, codifying it only adds ambiguity.

40,"Whether or not the accused has the right to face the accuser, or is entitled to due process, are all very important questions.

Thankfully enough, there exists another code of conduct that was put in place on other projects many years ago. It's been battle tested. Many arguments have been fought and resolved over its meaning. And most people accept its contents, or at the very least, follow it. That code of conduct is called ""the law"" and it dates back many centuries to Magna Carta (at least in the anglosphere.)

Why reinvent the wheel? Who benefits from that?

Open source projects wishing to ameliorate the very important concerns @parkr and @davidcelis have raised would be well-advised to consider adopting the FTFL-COC as defined by this document: https://gist.github.com/jart/f274d8dc156811a46b22

41,"@jart When we step into shared spaces and collaborative spaces, we often face scenarios where what is legal is not necessarily appropriate in that context. For example, it is legal for me to use expletives, but doing so in a theatre or a school is likely to get me removed.

Aside from that, the legal minimums vary wildly from nation to nation. What is legal in your country may not be legal in mine, so 'the law' is certainly not going to provide a baseline of acceptability in any international project.

The purpose of a Code of Conduct is not to 'reinvent' the law, but to build upon those basic expectations in order to foster a more welcoming environment. Whether a specific CoC gets the balance right is a worthwhile discussion, but creating an expected minimum standard of behaviour above 'follow the law' is certainly not revolutionary.

Having said that, I do think that CoCs should learn from years of common law. Things like the right to face accusations, the right to present evidence in defence, maximum 'sentences' and transparency as to decision making processes seem to have been forgotten in most (including this one).

Some of these are specifically called out and addressed in the CC. The underlying assumption is that a healthy, positive software community aspires to address– or at least not be complicit with– systemic patterns of abuse or discrimination, instead committing to being welcoming and encouraging diversity.

If a given project owner disagrees with this sentiment, does not believe in institutional or widespread social injustice, does not particularly care about creating and managing a welcoming and diverse community, or finds his or her values not aligned with those stated explicitly or implicitly in the CC then they shouldn’t adopt it.

14,@breanneboland I truly enjoyed both posts 👏 Thanks for taking the time to write it all out (and for doing the hard work that you wrote about 😊).

19,@dstevensio @DevRelians you got it!
20,"@PeterKimFrank @bendhalpern @jessleenyc ahhh I freaking LOVE that analogy! It works particularly well for me considering I often need my office clean before I can truly focus on work. Maybe this is the same “cleaning” process, but for my mind."

28,@compiledwrong It was such a pleasure to get to know you this evening! 😊 I’ll be diving into Libby as well as Rien’s Rebellion ASAP. 🙌🎉

42,"Huge props to @annthurium for this amazing trick:

They just asked for a show of fingers for how familiar we all are with JavaScript (1 finger for “what’s JS?” and 5 for expert). They then said they’d use that info to know how in-depth their definitions needed to be. #BRILLIANT"

53,@Khatie @FridayPush2Prod @rickheaton @Phenteo Fantastic - thanks! :)
54,"@ManekiDenise I'm curious about the premise that there are certain qualities that are ""unlearnable"" (Google Translate's version of the word 😅). I think some qualities might come easier to some than others, but I'd like to think that everyone can grow, striving to equip new qualities."
55,@FridayPush2Prod @Khatie @rickheaton @Phenteo Is there a link to the finished product? I'd love to watch!
56,"@mz__kev A few things most companies will look for in a dev looking to turn dev advocate:
1) ability to translate technical topics into easy-to-understand concepts
2) empathy for customers
3) involvement in open source projects or community events (meetups, conferences, etc.)"
57,@mz__kev Absolutely! I'd look into companies that are adding Dev Advocates to their team rather than one that's building a Developer Relations team from scratch (aka you'd be a team of one). They'll be able to set you up for success to learn from other teammates who have more experience.
58,"@ItS_Misan I don't know you, but saw your tweet while pulling together info for this week's DevRel Weekly newsletter and I'd love to hear more about what makes you think that! Happy to help in any way I can."
59,@bria_sullivan @MigMontemayor @techgirl1908 I'd love to hear more about this! I love that there are career workshops happening around Developer Relations.

66,@sigje ahh no! so sorry. deleting and starting over. thanks 😂
67,I'm excited to give this talk to a broad audience. No need to be in a particular location -- just in front of your very own computer in the comfort of your own office! Come learn about what #DevRel is and how it benefits you as an engineer. https://t.co/FBJxy7uMnP
68,"There’s some amazing advice in here for all speakers, whether you’re new or experienced. Take a look and then add your own advice! https://t.co/CP5op9pqMR"
69,@ChrisShort @FunnelFiasco @mike_julian @alexellisuk @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @QuinnyPig @garethr This is an easier conversation to have in person 😅 Wednesday perhaps? Otherwise it’s just going to be a mess of screenshots.
70,@ChrisShort @FunnelFiasco @mike_julian @alexellisuk @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @QuinnyPig @garethr I mean... are we talking how many RSS feeds? Or how many websites those RSS feeds compile? 😅
71,"@ChrisShort @FunnelFiasco @mike_julian @alexellisuk @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @QuinnyPig @garethr As far as analytics go, I've been struggling to figure out which pieces were most effective and why. e.g. Do I go based on engagement that the person got on their article/podcast/tweet? Or the number of click-throughs I got on the newsletter?"
72,@ChrisShort @FunnelFiasco @mike_julian @alexellisuk @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @QuinnyPig @garethr I'm guessing he was joking 😉 I do understand the sentiment tho! The reading/sorting/filtering takes so much time every week. Being able to increase the filtering via Zapier has gone a long way for me.
73,@ChrisShort @mike_julian @alexellisuk @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @QuinnyPig @garethr How do you find the content that is newsletter worthy? That's where my RSS feeds &gt; Zapier &gt; Pocket come into play.

75,@jtviolet Welcome home!
76,@evanhamilton @DEGoodmanWilson is on the DevRel team -- I'm guessing there's at least some overlap?

83,@ChrisShort @alexellisuk @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @mike_julian @QuinnyPig @garethr you mean a Twitter conversation isn't sufficient? 😆
84,"@alexellisuk @ChrisShort @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @mike_julian @QuinnyPig @garethr One more piece that was hugely helpful for me (and that I'm now noticing is lacking in Evernote:

- If I _can't_ archive the articles in a separate list, I need to be able to sort by ""untagged"" articles to see which ones I still need to sift through for this week's issue."
85,"@alexellisuk @ChrisShort @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @mike_julian @QuinnyPig @garethr I'm completely fine with paying for it! Freemium seems to be the way to go. I'd say my paying limit is probably $25/month, which is currently 5x what most of these platforms charge."
86,RT @remotesynth: Developer Relations (aka DevRel) has become a big part of the developer ecosystem in recent years...but why should devrel…
87,"@alexellisuk @ChrisShort @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @mike_julian @QuinnyPig @garethr must have:
- import via Zapien (pref) or IFTTT)
- ability to tag articles
- search (minimum title &amp; link) tho pref in-article
- bulk edit

nice:
- preview of article
- ability to archive articles
- multi-person login"
88,RT @skpodila: “Guys” is not a gender-neutral term when addressing a diverse group.  I wrote about why I care — https://t.co/RPmHu2mJZA
89,"@ChrisShort @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @mike_julian @QuinnyPig @garethr @alexellisuk It's not my favorite option but it looks like the only one that checks all the boxes right now  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I'm going to have to do some wrangling to import everything that I have in Pocket, but I think there's an IFTTT recipe that will work for that."
90,"@ChrisShort @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @mike_julian @QuinnyPig @garethr @alexellisuk I honestly think I'm just going to move things over to Evernote for the time being. It can do Zapier integrations. I can share the notebook with others. I can view card snippets &amp; bulk edit. I can tag things &amp; search within items. It's available offline, and it syncs w/iOS."
91,@ChrisShort @PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @mike_julian @pocketsupport @Pocket @QuinnyPig @garethr @alexellisuk happy to help however I can!
92,"@PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @ChrisShort @mike_julian @pocketsupport @Pocket @QuinnyPig @garethr You can actually use Zapier to pull an RSS feed _from_ Raindrop, but I need to be able to import items from multiple RSS feeds _into_ Raindrop on a continual basis. There are lots of ppl asking for it, but it hasn't been implemented yet and no longer seems to be on the roadmap."
93,@raindrop_io Any thoughts or plans around these integrations? There are a bunch of Premium Pocket members who are now stranded because of their recent changes which broke our workflow. We're more than willing to pay... we just need the Zapier/IFTTT integrations.
94,"@IAmJerdog @PreciselyAlyss @ChrisShort @mike_julian @pocketsupport @Pocket @QuinnyPig @garethr I just found the reason why I (and likely others) can't use it -- there's no Zapier or IFTTT integration 😩 I'll keep digging... it's possible that among us we can figure out a way to build the integration ourselves using their API, but it's not a solution I can integrate today."
95,@davidgsIoT Thanks 😊❤️
96,@PreciselyAlyss @IAmJerdog @ChrisShort @mike_julian @pocketsupport @Pocket @QuinnyPig @garethr good to know! I’m hopeful 😊 Thanks for the tip.
97,@ChrisShort @mike_julian @pocketsupport @Pocket @QuinnyPig @garethr What about Raindrop? 🤔 https://t.co/8IPkr4l1oL It looks promising... I might play around with it this afternoon.
98,"@ChrisShort @mike_julian @pocketsupport @Pocket @QuinnyPig Tho I'm seeing that it's iOS/Android only... not computers :( So is Figgle.

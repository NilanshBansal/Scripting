Thanks so much for a lovely event!
"Thanks, Peter! And thank you, Vanessa:) You guys are awesome"
Excellent!
"[masked] Dear Vanessa, Peter, and all the very kind people that made the event informative and interesting, Thank you, very much, for a very enjoyable evening! The Vintner, Grant Ramey was especially nice. Oh, and the wine was pretty darn great too. And, someone moved my cheese, hee,hee. You know who you are... Be well to all. v"
"Minus two stars for Google SF for an extremely rude lobby man. He told my party of 8 we didn't read the sign, which had directions for g-glass to floor 5, and something on floor 4, but zero mention of the meetup on floor 6. I told him the sign has no mention of the meetup, and he directly insulted me by saying ""let me talk to someone else, who has an education"". Absolutely awful way to treat your guests."
"Seeing everyone here is making me think a trip back to SF is in order soon. I'm still waiting to finally talk to Kate in person. Even if we live in the same city now. 
My question would be, if you are a founder, acting as a community manager, how do you separate yourself from the community so if you were to leave, the community would still exist?"
https://www.slideshare.net/AanchalBatra4/presentation-121291593
"I have to say that if there was a commercial interest the talk would have been about the Chef features in the product.We just wanted to share experiences and spread the jclouds-chef word, and that's why we chose to talk about how we use it internally in our CI workflows. Really nice meetup guys! It's been nice to meet you all!"
"@Jason, I am really sorry about this. I am following up with the event staff about this."
"Thank you Peter. For my comment above, its solely aimed at the building management, and really appreciate you following up. For the actual event, it was 5 stars, and another great meetup."
"[masked] Dear Jason, Maybe, he was in a low mood, maybe... I would not take it personally. Be well. v"
"Waiting for those slides :)
Thank you for a good time!"
The sketches (in the meetup photos) are really great. Who is the artist?
Glad you like them. It's the very talented artist Auguste Haboush who decided to drop by.
I liked them too. Who is Auguste Haboush? Where is he from?
He teaches art at the SF Academy of Art University.
"I felt that the talks were well-coordinated with each other to give an cohesive overview of the major issues. So any single talk was strong and good in itself, but the sequence was logical in a way that they added to each other. I think the break times are great if you are with some other people, drinking, and have to go to the bathroom each time. Sadly, I only could have one dessert as they ran out, but this is probably a feature and not a bug, to prevent diabetes."
Last presentation was the best. I felt the waiver to enter was overly broad and should have been limited to the event.  Google were fantastic hosts otherwise
"FWIW, the form had the exact date, event name, and location on it."
"Thanks, Peter! I didn't see that information specified anywhere on waiver, but I would have gladly signed had I seen that information."
"Fun times, great talk, and awesome location!"
This was a very good group of talks about security. A lot of useful and easy to understand examples.
"Although all the 4 talks tonight were excellent, great food, music. I just wish if the breaks in between we're that long, we can be out earlier before 10 and be home on time for people with long commute. Overall meetup was excellent and thanks!"
"This was great! Very informative. Thank you so much, Katie."
typo: were not*
"I agree, shorter breaks would be better"
My favorite SFHTML5 meetup so far
Thanks Peter & Vanessa & the team from Google for hosting! Great talks; good eats; interesting convos:)
"Great meetup! Also, for anyone looking to participate in the June 5th day to improve web security, go to resetthenet.org to register your website."
"Great session, great speakers. Would meet again."
Best meet up yet!
"Excellent content and food, well organized"
Meetup was great.If you can share those slides
"I really enjoyed it.  Great place, great people, great tech."
is this just boozing and socializing?
"Great talkers, rich topics, awesome perks (food, beer, wine, raffles and Bay Bridge sights). Way to go, Google!"
"I can't see it live on Youtube, only sponsors ads are going on"
"there are a handful of free reports, stickers, and discount codes from O'Reilly Media on the swag table. Be sure to check them out & grab them quickly -- they won't last long!"
"Traffic looks bad, so I'm  giving up 2 spots."
There are free IE stickers... hurry up or they might all be gone by the time you arrive...  lol

There's traffic gridlock in the area. Please consider taking public transit (or walk/bike).
Can I attend even though RSVPs are closed?
"If you are on the wait list, feel free to come down now."
"Hi, a friend of mine would like to come, but it seems the rsvp is closed. I can see there are still some spots left. What should he do to join?"
"Looking forward to this all week! See you guys there! And if you're hiring, I'm a contracting UI/UX designer/dev with front end skills, going back into full-time. I'll be in a blue Billabong hat, come say hi :)"

"Hello there, 

When I RSVP for this event I did + 1 how can I verify this went through?"
Hi! I'm a visiting ECE student from Malaysia and find this super interesting! The RSVP is closed but is there any chance I can still get in? Is the waiting list available?
"Hi Roti: If you arrive early tomorrow (5p), you should be able to join the waiting list and get into the event."
Thanks Vanessa! I'll be there tomorrow!
"Please note that you must be a member of SFHTML5 to attend tomorrow, so register before you come down."
It was amazing!!! I am surely coming back next month!
"I just canceled my RSVP, incase you were still going :)!"
"for those waiting, outside chance i wont make it."
"Really wanted to go, but I've been feeling under the weather the past few days, so I'm freeing up an RSVP."
Where is the entrance?
"I freed up an RSVP - thank you for providing the live stream, I will patch in with you all then."
"Likewise, just freed up my RSVP. I'll watch the stream to save a trip to SF, and somebody on the wait list can take my place...."
Note: the waitlist is automatically updated and people are notified via an email from Meetup when they are moved to the guest list.
just declined my RSVP to make room for a wait-lister since I can no longer go.  will look forward to the screencast
"[masked] Dear Vanessa, Thank you for all your efforts that you have done to make this a great event! Be well to all.  Cordially, Virginia"
"I'm clearing my spot, not going to be able to make it."
"There are 2 spots left but RSVP is closed.I'd really like to get one of the 2 spots, thanks!"
"Hi Twain: Please check your mail for instructions for the wait list tomorrow. We'll be admitting folks from the wait list on a first come, first served basis and there's a good chance we'll be able to admit most."
I'm passionate about security
I'm in!

"Wow, another great set of talks!"
Can't wait! Last time I was at Google SF got some great pics and video. See you guys there :)
"Since I cannot see a price listed anywhere here, does that mean the meetup is free of charge? I've RSVPed on Meetup.com, do I need to do anything else to guarantee my spot?

I am also assuming we should bring our laptops and be ready for hands-on interaction.

This will be my first time at Google San Francisco and it looks like it's going to rock."
"Hi Aaron -- the event is free. Your RSVP says ""yes"" and therefore you do not need to do anything else at this time. On the day of the event, please arrive early (before 6p) to ensure you get a spot in the room. There is guest WiFi available."
"I just found out I'll no longer be able to attend this Meetup, but I already paid. I'd like to give my ticket away to a friend of mine who's interested, is that possible to do when it was paid for via Meetup?"

Thanks for your feedback. We will try to schedule an event around that soon.
But what  fi you have that's veggie?
"I'm also interested in the streaming question.
I may also have a plus 1."
"Hey Howard, +1s are fine. :)"
"Could you also send me the menu??  

I'm veggie and also gluten free and have had some difficulty at the recent events....

That could tell me if I need to bring my own rice or GF bread, etc."
"Hey Howard, Sadly we won't be able to accommodate gluten free diet."
Are you going to live stream the live sessions?
Hey Norman - Sadly we won't be able to live stream the sessions.
"...between the Democratic Convention at Moscone and this meetup, that's a hard choice!"
Is there any entrance fee or it’s a free event with walkin
It’s a free event.
"Hey folks!

We are excited to have you all at the event. Please note that the workshop in the afternoon is for all levels and geared towards newbies in open source. Please make sure that you have a github account and bring your laptops and chargers along.

See you all then!"
We are at a reserved table on the far left side of the bar (in the back) 🥳
"Hi everyone, hope you’re as excited as we are! If you haven’t left already, I highly recommend leaving some extra time for parking. 😉 see you soon!"
"Hi folks,

I'm seeing the RSVPs ticking up past 300 so it's time to   state the obvious caveats :-)

Our venue is meant to hold about half that number. More importantly, we are budgeting for food/drinks for about 150-175 people.

We have tried to micro-manage RSVPs in the past and always found that we'd have open seats & no-shows (while people who really wanted to be there were waitlisted) - however when we let this play out, it seems to work out best since those who *can* make it, often do arrive early.

Please be aware that venue seating, food/drink & swag will be on a first-come-first served basis. When we reach capacity, we will try to post a comment to this space to let you know but in general we find we reach full capacity by 7pm. 

Other than that, we look forward to seeing you all one last time before 2018, and wish everyone in this community a happy & productive New Year in advance."

"Thank You all for coming and enjoying the tech fun with us! Thank you to our speakers who did such an excellent job in sharing their knowledge and experience in fun and interesting ways. Thank you to the volunteers who helped with setup and cleanup. Thank you to our sponsors who made it possible to host this event for FREE, yet still have food and swag for everyone in a nice comfy venue. See you all soon!"
"Great people, great food, free stuff and learning along the way! However, the place was small and seats were not all focused toward the screen and the screen was pretty small in itself. The speakers were cool but it felt a little too advanced and I was lost during several parts of their presentation. I guess they all assumed we would know what they are talking about. If the description had a little info on what we should have known prior to coming, that would have been nicer. Other than that, fantastic event given that it's at no cost to you."
"Thanks for attending tonight!  I hope you enjoyed yourselves and learned a thing or two along the way.

The FREE codes for Day 2 expire tonight at midnight. After that you can still participate in the Hackathon if there are seats available - but you may not get a FREE pass anymore since we will be switching over to promoting the Tech talks (Day 1) & Workshops (Day 2) that happen alongside."

"Hi all - thank you all SO much for showing up, sharing ideas & working through codelabs. 

My huge thanks to Trey, Kirill, Michael, Sherzat & Richie for mentoring - and to Lakshma &  Donna for helping manage event logistics. Also to Sheny (our Google host) for all the help with venue arrangements & staying till the end to help us close this out!

AppFest Hackathon steps are as follows:

1. 
Fill in the Call-For-Participation here:  http://bit.ly/appfestNY-cfp-2017

2.
Registered folks will receive a PROMO code for free DevFest Day 2 registration tomorrow morning. Use that to register for the appropriate ticket on EventBrite by tomorrow night.

3.
All ticketed attendees will be invited into a Slack channel to start pre-event discussions/team-formation etc.

4.
No code to be written prior to Sunday Dec 3. However you can plan ideas, explore codelabs & samples (to validate requirements) & identify who-does-what. Teams should be 2-4 people.

Look forward to seeing you all on Dec 2-3!"
"Hi all - we are going to setup the room with tables (for codelabs) & stack chairs on the sides to accommodate as many as we can. 

I don't have the bandwidth to micro-manage the RSVP lists - we always have no-shows which makes me feel guilty about those on waitlists who didn't get to attend.

So this time I am letting it play out. Be aware that seats will be first-come first-served. I want this to benefit as many people as possible so if for any reason we hit capacity, I will share all content/materials afterwards on this page as well.

Bring your laptops/power cords. If you can't make it at 4pm that's okay - we'll do a shorter recap at 6:30pm for the regular session arrivals.

Finally, please be kind to each other and to the organizers. Holidays tend to be stressful so let's take care of each other & ourselves. This is an amazing community and we can get through this.

See you then."

3. If you were talking to a group of CIO's what would your primary messages to them be?
4. How does it offer business agility, speed to market, regulatory compliance, increased market share, client analytics, expansion and transformation opportunity, leadership in business performance? In other words, why would I buy?

Thanks, MO"

"This event is sponsored as a unConference where subjects are proposed as you come in the door.  The initial introduction provided participants with an explanation that subjects will be discussed in a round table fashion utilizing the more heads are better than one principle.

The reality is that most presentations were prepared beforehand and presented with a request for questions.  The actual conference sharply deviated from the proposed venue where a group of people participate equally in finding solutions to difficult issues.  The structured presentations that were  given provided less value than I expected.

As a value proposition, bang for time invested, I rate this conference very low. I would not recommend this event to other CEOs with limited time trying to get traction.  Their time is better spent in the trenches."
"when do tickets go on sale? I'd love to attend this, but Eventbrite is telling me all sales have ended. Thanks!"
"Huge thanks to the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View for letting us use their space! I did need to cap our event attendance as we have a room that can only hold about 25-30 people.  

Good news though, I'm already looking to organize our January event, and will post more about that and a date soon!. 

Thanks, and hope you all had a super thanks giving!"
"Those slides are very informational and helpful for people new to version 12. If possible, can we share those slides somewhere later on?

One thing I learned from the presentation is Chef provisioning. We currently has service dependencies on a certain services starting/running parallel on multiple nodes and other services will need to listen to status of completion from these nodes in order to proceed rest of the run-list. We were home-growning couple ways of doing this, but with this standard way is much better.

Also the community and enterprise unification is a good move, we are looking forward to much stable codebase."
We're all super excited to get some great action for our LoCo.

"This is awesome that we are putting together a presentation on puppet. I was wondering if you needed any help with it. I have been using puppet to support production servers for over a year and was actually interviewing for a role as a Professional Services Engineer with Puppet Labs. Have you had a chance to check out the book ""Pro Puppet"" by James Turnbull? Great book by a great guy who unfortunately recently left Puppet.

I have given talks on puppet before and think that I could contribute to this presentation. Jon, et al. would you be interested in collaborating?"
Unfortunately I didn't estimate how much preparation I'd have to do for moving on Friday... Sorry ladies :( Hoping someone else can take my spot!
"We made it happen! The presentation is split into 2 parts. Here are the links:
PART 1: http://vimeo.com/92770954
PART 2: https://vimeo.com/92838680

*Note: The video might not play properly in Chrome."
"Another answer that you'll read in other places, Nagios was built for other times and places.
Sensu concept of ""monitoring router"" is well worth looking at it if you haven't. It allows to create monitoring pipeline that scale with your infrastructure and unlike others *cough* riemann *cough* its architecture, configuration and customization is...simple!"
"I am really interested to hear about Sensu. But by the way, we have no problems with ""dynamic"" infrastructure and ""dynamic"" checks with Nagios 3 Core (more than 2000 hosts and more than 10000 checks every 1/5 minutes).  Simply load host configuration from CMDB and service configuration from SVN (any version control system) every few hours. It works for 2 or 3 years now. That's ""monitoring pipeline""."
"Random question I would like to ask the group. Does anyone here work for tumblr or have used/know about their cmdb tool ""Collins""? http://tumblr.github.io/collins/ we're looking at writing something similar, so would love some thoughts / ideas on this. Or even a demo..."

Thank you for great talks!!

"I believe that the more we, GDG NYC, scales in size, the more benefits our group can add for its members despite the growing pains of space limitations. Nitya and the other organizers are working hard to organize events that addresses the hunger that developers have for the amazing Google technologies being released at I/O 2017. Impressed with how the GDG NYC community has grown in one year. I remember attending last year's I/O  event in the Chelsea Market when the room was furnished differently. Now there is twice as many seats, full house, and a wait list for this year's hot event. (For those who couldn't make it, we'll try to upload videos from those speakers who give permission.)"
"The conference discounted ticket link is not working for me, can someone help?"
"Hello Adam, you were confirmed to attend our IO Extended Meetup. Reminders and Confirmation mails are automatically taken care by Meetup service. Am not sure how you missed notifications, am pretty confident everyone else was notified and reminded promptly. See you for our future events. Have a wonderful evening."

Fantastic event!  Thank you!
"Hi everyone -- hope to see you all tomorrow. A couple of quick notes:


1. 
The regular event begins at 6pm but doors will be open from 4pm onwards for anyone who wants to arrive early and work on codelabs. Bring your own laptop to use for this.

2. 
We accepted a number of ""lightning talks"" from community members to kick this off. Please note that each speaker here will have only 5 mins for their segment -- if you would like to do a longer talk, come speak to an organizer. We do plan to do follow-up ""deep-dive"" events into specific technologies and would be happy to schedule the longer talk there.


Finally, are trying to work around the continuing no-show problem by increasing the number of confirmed RSVPs but note that we do have a fixed venue capacity so we hope to accommodate people until all seats are filled. We give priority to regular attendees and first-timers so do remember to ""check-in"" your attendance with Lakshma when you arrive."
@paul I think you are confusing between IO and IO Extended meetup. This one is run by community for benefit of community interested in Google API's and other technologies.
"Suman you are right on, our organizers' volunteer time has benefited us all a lot...the speakers and topics at each GDG NYC basically rock, Nitya and Ralph with assist from Jenn et als. are always reaching out for feedback to improve, plus their alerts/invites for special events like Android Camp at the UN, machine learning etc. are phenomenal...they have helped build a positive community with and within the group, happy to be part of it and applaud their sincere efforts on our behalf."
"Hey Ivan -- yes I sent email now as well. Our I/O Recap is in June. 

There is an I/O INVITE ONLY viewing event at Google today but there were only limited invites available -- we got oversubscribed.

IF YOU WERE SELECTED FROM THE LIST OF APPLICANTS, YOU WILL HAVE RECEIVED AN EMAIL INVITE FROM GOOGLE EARLIER.

If you don't have an invite then you didn't make the list. Sorry about that."
"Hi everyone! Thanks for an awesome lightning talk event, these are always my favorite at WWC :)

We're also partnering with Developer Week, which takes place Feb 1-7, to get you 20% off their event.

We hope you start tinkering with them soon so you can show off your project at an upcoming meetup. Thank you Google for the ongoing support and sponsorship!"
I am throwing you softballs my friend. You are welcome. 😄 Seriously while I do enjoy straying off the beaten path it is important to mention the appropriate caveats and alternatives not the least of which is cost. Hosting my action using Node/Express in App Engine costs a few bucks a day (thankfully in Google play money) while a Firebase function would cost much less maybe nada.
"Judging by the number of you who stopped by to chat AFTER my talk last night - and thanks for that feedback - it seems there may be more than a little interest in Google Actions.  

I have a presentation here 

http://tinyurl.com/y7wadltv

that explains how Chrome begat V8, and V8 begat Node and Node begat Express and then how Google said let there be Actions! It includes links to testing tools and a bare-bones code sample.

Note that it strays from the well-trodden - and Prisoner-approved :-)  - path of using a ""serverless"" deployment and Dialog Flow for the NLU in favor of a plain vanilla Node/Express combo. 

Mostly that is because it is so simple a sample it doesn't try to understand language but merely repeats it and it was never intended to be deployed. Still, it may not be a bad place to start learning how to build an Action. Or not.

Happy holidays"
Can't wait to see you all soon!

"Here's the answer to your question, Tim. Matthew Levene wrote up a summary of the discussion, so this is copied from that: ""We have to remove ourselves as the central node in the community. Do this sooner rather than later. Being the central node is not sustainable. Eventually the community has to be responsible for running the community. The community has to be primarily responsible for sharing amongst each other and bringing in new people."""
"A couple of us showed up at the Founders Den at 665 3rd Street at 6:30pm. Did the address change? Where did I get that other address from? Weird. Sorry I missed it, was looking forward to seeing everyone. I'll catch you next time."
or maybe I just got the name of the space wrong? Don't know why I had that address though!
It did change at one point. I got the address from this page earlier today

Is this a good event for asking peers for help integrating an app with Google Play Services?

Perfect combo of informative and entertaining.
"Overall an amazing meetup in terms of venue, food, and amenities! 

I didn't immediately see the connection to html5, but it was a good window into how creating web applications is evolving.

One question for any of the speakers, I guess Colt in particular is, what do you see as the drawbacks for serverless architecture? I mean, it sure seems you are relying a lot on 3rd parties, which granted, are probably just as, or more reliable than your own architecture, but still, it seems a bit tenuous. You don't want yer ship to fall apart, after all. ;)

I sort of have the same question with Firebase, though did get a better feel that the tradeoff for outsourcing security and stability is a little less flexibility (at least how I understood it)."
I look forward to this every year. Thanks so much for keeping the tradition going!!
Thanks to all the great speakers. Amazing performances!
Great presentations
"thanks Peter, Vanessa, all the speakers and all the contributors for another fun and thoroughly enriching program"
what a meetup. thanks for that guys.

This Fest was very informative! Can someone please post the link to the slides here.Thank you!
Amazing fest cant wait for this next year 😄
"Can hardly wait to attend next year. Having it on a Friday was great. Though, I would have preferred it was later in the year."
anyone selling the ticket??! I’m willing to buy the ticket. :)
Will bringing a laptop be beneficial?
"I usually bring a laptop to take high level notes. Honestly a pen and notebook usually would suffice too.

My recommendation is if this is your first time at a conference bring your laptop and see how it works out."
Awesome! First time for sure. So a fully charged laptop it is.
I was one of those people who were late to buy the tickets. If anyone is not going and want to sell their tickets please let me know. Thanks
If anyone can't go and can sell me their ticket please let me know ty

"I'm assuming you are wondering what some of the talks will be and unfortunately at this time we have not selected the talks. I can tell you that we have some great talks submitted with topics such as Tensorflow, Firebase, Progressive Web Apps, Kotlin, Smart home and there is still time for other great talks to get submitted! I hope this helps you decide to come. 

Be aware that right now we are doing our early bird pricing and when we announce the lineup of speakers we will raise the price."
We have gotten a bunch of the talks online please make sure to check out the site now. More to come over the next few days! https://windycity.devfest.io

Love the enthusiasm behind topics but remember you need to buy your tickets on Eventbrite https://windycity.devfest.io get your early bird tickets now before they are gone!
Buying tickets on Monday
Remember that time Monday came and went for like a month and I still don't see a ticket from you....
One week left to get your tickets at early bird prices! Tickets will be going up in price once all the speakers are announced next week! I will say this is shaping up to be a great conference. Over 30 submissions for talks so far. Awesome giveaways and your typical conference style swag! Head over to https://windycitydevfest.eventbrite.com to get your early bird ticket today!
Friendly Reminder less then 2 weeks left to get your early bird takes. 1 week left to get your speaker submissions in! Can't wait to show you guys all of what we have up our sleeves! https://windycity.devfest.io

Kotlin for the win
Progressive web apps all day!
"Great discussion, looking forward to moving on next steps!"
"Unfortunately, the original venue changed their commitment very last minute. Our team was lucky to find PSR on such a short notice. We hope to see you today, Howard."
"Looks like the address changed.  I thought this was originally at Dharma College, 2222 Harold Way, Berkeley.  Not so close to BART now.  Its about 3/4s of a mile, up hill at the end."
We’ll be getting started at 7:30!
It was pretty nice meeting you
"I hope you will be able to record this, I can't make this new date.

Thanks."
"Idea 8: 
Centralized announcer -- allow people nearby to route announcements to a popular/extrovert nearby who can announce them"
Thank you guys. Minus the hiccups outside of everyone's control it was an awesome way of learning about Chef.
"Please feel free to contact me at @RobertCrowdis. I'm on Github, Meetup (obviously) and Twitter. I mainly work with Angular technology, but I'm always willing to learn. Let's connect!"

"Hello. What should we install for the CodeLab on our laptops? More generally, what prereqs would the CodeLab involve?

Thanks!

- Frank Solomon"
Hi Frank. Great question. I would suggest having either Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA installed.
"Thanks to all those who attended our meetup yesterday evening, and to the speakers Xavier Fernandez, Ignasi Barrera and Zac Stevens - both sessions were very informative.

Thanks also Jon Cowie for coming along and giving a heads up on his new book, 'Customizing Chef'.  You can get more details on the book, along with a discount at http://www.jonliv.es/book.

We will send out a notification for our next event once we have more details on date & speakers.  Please let us know if you're up for giving a talk on a particular topic, or even a 5-10 minute lightning talk."
"Hi all - in case you haven't already signed up for the 1-day Firebase Hackathon at DevFestNYC on Dec 4 - please do so now http://bit.ly/appfestNY-cfp-2017


We have just about 10-15 spots left to fill and I want to give the community a chance to fill them before we open it up to everyone via DevFest publicity"
Great to see everyone at the event. Good talks and interesting discussions.
"Note: it is not mandatory to participate in the Hackathon - but why would you not want to? :-)  Click that link to understand requirements.

All participants get a free ticket to Day 2 of DevFest (and all its swag) plus a subsidized ticket to Day 1 (tech talks). Plus the Firebase team will be sending engineers to help mentor and judge the winning apps. It's a chance to do something fun & productive. 

Plus - Dec 3 marks the start of CSEdWeek - consider this your official completion of the HourOfCode :-)"
I signed up when this was first mentioned.  Will we get an email notification or something about the details of the event?
Yup! James is totally right. If you have Android Studio 3.3+ installed you should be good to go.

Also, I realized there was no date on the postcard about the women's meetup we're holding next week at Fluent--d'oh! It's Tues, May 28 at the Hilton Union Square, starting at 5:30. Everyone is welcome (guys too)! http://oreil.ly/FL13WCMU"

How wonderful to see so many women coders in one room!

"Thanks, Carlos! We also have a YouTube channel, where you can find all our recordings: bit.ly/sfhtml5youtube"
Signed up and looking forward to this event.
"I'm sorry to cancel last minute as well, stuck at work until 8, hopefully someone can take my spot.  I'm working on a documentary about women tech founders so if this applies to you please reach out! Thanks again for throwing this event."
This will be amazing.
Hi there. I never received an email on the raffle ticket I got for the ForwardJS conference. Email is [masked]. I 'm 90% positive the ticket ended in 542 if that helps.
"Nora, I am a woman founder of an ed tech start up.  LMK if I can help."
"Hi Tim, Can you send us an email at sfhtml5 at gmail dot com."
Awesome!
Can't get away just yet...sorry to miss it.

Awesome event with an interesting speaker and great people!
Thanks to Katie and Google for an awesome event; SFHTML5 is the coolest tech Meetup in San Francisco for sure!
Everything was great!
Great! Very informative and invigorating.

Stuck @ work. So looking forward for this.
It was amazing!!! I am surely coming back next month!
Where is the entrance?
Got some last minute work :( Really was looking forward towards it .
"I just found out I'll no longer be able to attend this Meetup, but I already paid. I'd like to give my ticket away to a friend of mine who's interested, is that possible to do when it was paid for via Meetup?"
???
Paying at the door;  No longer trust internet and cards.
"Hi, I have been summoned for jury duty on a day that tends to conflict with the date of this event. I hope to be able to attend, assuming that I am not needed for the jury duty."

"Thanks, Peter! And thank you, Vanessa:) You guys are awesome"
"[masked] Dear Vanessa, Peter, and all the very kind people that made the event informative and interesting, Thank you, very much, for a very enjoyable evening! The Vintner, Grant Ramey was especially nice. Oh, and the wine was pretty darn great too. And, someone moved my cheese, hee,hee. You know who you are... Be well to all. v"
"Minus two stars for Google SF for an extremely rude lobby man. He told my party of 8 we didn't read the sign, which had directions for g-glass to floor 5, and something on floor 4, but zero mention of the meetup on floor 6. I told him the sign has no mention of the meetup, and he directly insulted me by saying ""let me talk to someone else, who has an education"". Absolutely awful way to treat your guests."
"@Jason, I am really sorry about this. I am following up with the event staff about this."
"Thank you Peter. For my comment above, its solely aimed at the building management, and really appreciate you following up. For the actual event, it was 5 stars, and another great meetup."
"[masked] Dear Jason, Maybe, he was in a low mood, maybe... I would not take it personally. Be well. v"
"Waiting for those slides :)
Thank you for a good time!"
The sketches (in the meetup photos) are really great. Who is the artist?
Glad you like them. It's the very talented artist Auguste Haboush who decided to drop by.
I liked them too. Who is Auguste Haboush? Where is he from?
He teaches art at the SF Academy of Art University.
You need to use the same material as twillio. I don't think I'd wear the one you gave out at drinkup0 because it's not comfortable.

"Wow. Totally flaked on this. We need an auto export to Outlook as soon as I hit ""accept"" with auto-push notifications. Come on, meetup."
"I felt that the talks were well-coordinated with each other to give an cohesive overview of the major issues. So any single talk was strong and good in itself, but the sequence was logical in a way that they added to each other. I think the break times are great if you are with some other people, drinking, and have to go to the bathroom each time. Sadly, I only could have one dessert as they ran out, but this is probably a feature and not a bug, to prevent diabetes."
Last presentation was the best. I felt the waiver to enter was overly broad and should have been limited to the event.  Google were fantastic hosts otherwise
"FWIW, the form had the exact date, event name, and location on it."
"Thanks, Peter! I didn't see that information specified anywhere on waiver, but I would have gladly signed had I seen that information."
"Folks, can't make it tonight.  But will certainly make it next time.  BTW, looking for an engineer/coder interested in the ed tech space.  Huge traction, huge potential.  Check out openstudy.com and get a sense of the action. After the all male team that built it, would LOVE to have a woman engineer. Lift/Scala/MongoDb anyone?"
"Fun times, great talk, and awesome location!"
This was a very good group of talks about security. A lot of useful and easy to understand examples.
"Although all the 4 talks tonight were excellent, great food, music. I just wish if the breaks in between we're that long, we can be out earlier before 10 and be home on time for people with long commute. Overall meetup was excellent and thanks!"
typo: were not*
"I agree, shorter breaks would be better"
My favorite SFHTML5 meetup so far
Thanks Peter & Vanessa & the team from Google for hosting! Great talks; good eats; interesting convos:)
"Great meetup! Also, for anyone looking to participate in the June 5th day to improve web security, go to resetthenet.org to register your website."
"Great session, great speakers. Would meet again."
Best meet up yet!
"Excellent content and food, well organized"
"Great talkers, rich topics, awesome perks (food, beer, wine, raffles and Bay Bridge sights). Way to go, Google!"
"I can't see it live on Youtube, only sponsors ads are going on"
"there are a handful of free reports, stickers, and discount codes from O'Reilly Media on the swag table. Be sure to check them out & grab them quickly -- they won't last long!"
"Traffic looks bad, so I'm  giving up 2 spots."
There are free IE stickers... hurry up or they might all be gone by the time you arrive...  lol
pic.twitter.com/F6RMCXndXo
I'm here _right now_
There's traffic gridlock in the area. Please consider taking public transit (or walk/bike).
Can I attend even though RSVPs are closed?
"If you are on the wait list, feel free to come down now."
"Hi, a friend of mine would like to come, but it seems the rsvp is closed. I can see there are still some spots left. What should he do to join?"
"Is this the correct url for the slides? https://speakerdeck.com/ariya 
I don't see today's presentation yet."
Yes. The slides haven't been uploaded yet though. Stay tuned :)
"Looking forward to this all week! See you guys there! And if you're hiring, I'm a contracting UI/UX designer/dev with front end skills, going back into full-time. I'll be in a blue Billabong hat, come say hi :)"
"Hey Jason, there are at least 4 design openings at Indiegogo - https://www.indiegogo.com/careers - do fun tech and change people's lives."
"Dear Sean, Hope you feel better soon!  Thank you for the post. Cordially, v"
"Last minute business meeting... had to change RSVP :(

Have fun guys"
"Hello there, 

When I RSVP for this event I did + 1 how can I verify this went through?"
Hi! I'm a visiting ECE student from Malaysia and find this super interesting! The RSVP is closed but is there any chance I can still get in? Is the waiting list available?
"Hi Roti: If you arrive early tomorrow (5p), you should be able to join the waiting list and get into the event."
Thanks Vanessa! I'll be there tomorrow!
"Please note that you must be a member of SFHTML5 to attend tomorrow, so register before you come down."
"I just canceled my RSVP, incase you were still going :)!"
"for those waiting, outside chance i wont make it."
"Really wanted to go, but I've been feeling under the weather the past few days, so I'm freeing up an RSVP."
"I freed up an RSVP - thank you for providing the live stream, I will patch in with you all then."
"Likewise, just freed up my RSVP. I'll watch the stream to save a trip to SF, and somebody on the wait list can take my place...."
Note: the waitlist is automatically updated and people are notified via an email from Meetup when they are moved to the guest list.
just declined my RSVP to make room for a wait-lister since I can no longer go.  will look forward to the screencast
"[masked] Dear Vanessa, Thank you for all your efforts that you have done to make this a great event! Be well to all.  Cordially, Virginia"
"I'm clearing my spot, not going to be able to make it."
"There are 2 spots left but RSVP is closed.I'd really like to get one of the 2 spots, thanks!"
"Hi Twain: Please check your mail for instructions for the wait list tomorrow. We'll be admitting folks from the wait list on a first come, first served basis and there's a good chance we'll be able to admit most."
I'm passionate about security
I'm in!
Would I be allowed to bring a video camera to record?
The event is already being recorded
"Hi Byron. No. However, we are live streaming and recording the event and the recording will be available right after the event."
"ok thanks, looking forward to it"
There is a bike rack inside the gated area which is off street to lock up your bikes.
Thanks!
What if I have no lock? Is it still safe to leave the bike here?
"It's still ""outdoor"", just behind their front gate (that's open right now)."
Sorry to change so late. Last minute scheduling issue.
"For all HTML5ers, I've blogged the status of Heartbleed bug. Interestingly, only 0.53 percent of the top 10,000 websites remain vulnerable

Hello
"Hi gals, I can't make it tonight, but wanted to give a shout-out.  I'm looking for great female engineers for a game-changing health care startup.  You can check us out on angellist:  https://angel.co/the-cognitive-healthcare-company.  See you at the next meetup!"
"Hi, I wanted to know how long is the wait list? I would really love to attend this event.

Thank you"
"$('#wait-list').text().trim()

or just search for ""waiting"" -> 18"
"Sorry, not feeling well.  Hopefully next time."
"The waiting list is managed by Meetup, if you move up on the list and get an empty spot you will get an email telling you so.

Show up the day of the event, most likely you will be allowed in, based on the people who are registered and don't show up"
"What a great teaser from Mr. Eduardo Vela Nava: ""you will be completely convinced, that the best way to develop secure software is by knowing absolutely nothing about security."" I'd like to hear that - maybe a focus on quality first?  :)"
"Psyched to join the meetup tonight. I'm VP of Engineering at BandPage, and always looking to meet fellow female coders. Also, and not entirely coincidentally, I'm hiring! Looking forward to meeting some interesting folks and hearing some cool talks!  :-)"
"Wow, another great set of talks!"
Can't wait! Last time I was at Google SF got some great pics and video. See you guys there :)
"I have to work late tonight and won't make it. To whoever takes my spot, enjoy!"
"Since I cannot see a price listed anywhere here, does that mean the meetup is free of charge? I've RSVPed on Meetup.com, do I need to do anything else to guarantee my spot?

I am also assuming we should bring our laptops and be ready for hands-on interaction.

This will be my first time at Google San Francisco and it looks like it's going to rock."
"Hi Aaron -- the event is free. Your RSVP says ""yes"" and therefore you do not need to do anything else at this time. On the day of the event, please arrive early (before 6p) to ensure you get a spot in the room. There is guest WiFi available."
"Sorry, can't make it tonight - hopefully someone else can take my spot."
"[masked] Hello Vanessa, Thank you for the post.  I too was wondering if the event is complimentary; it is, yeah! Be well. v"
Make sure that you send the organizers your full (First & Last names) since it's not part of your user ID. This helps smooth out the security process.
"I'm going to have to miss this one.  Sorry.  Also, I signed up to speak so can you take my name off the list.  Thanks - see you next time."
[masked] Thank you Misty for bringing the information to my attention.  Be well. v
Wish I could be there - but I'm in Austin!
"It's possible I won't make it until 7. Is that okay, or should I give up my spot?"
"Last minute conflict, hope to make the next one."
"I had intended to send a poll out last week, but got super busy...  I have one now!"

Out of town
It was good to discuss DevOps issues as related to language.
Great!!  Learned a Lot Thanks YOU
"Security needs your first and last name so if it is not listed on Meetup Please email it to me alainapercival @ gmail.com 

If you aren't going to be able to attend please update your RSVP we have quite a few people on the waiting list. 

Finally, if you really wanted to give a talk and didn't get to signup in time please send me an email with your topic."
Fingers crossed!
unfortunately I can't make it this time :(
"I would love to attend this event, but I'm on the waitlist! We are looking for an awesome Ruby on Rails developer to join our team at www.DohJe.com, making it easy to thank great caregivers."
Just joined this. Can't wait to attend my first meetup.
Just starting to learn code
My battery adapter arrived this morning!
"Hi 
I used to be a noncoder - but getting into it.  Powering up!  I am looking for a Scala hacker for a part-time/ could grow into full time position."
Hello! I've just joined this group. I am so glad so many coder girls come together here. I am excited to join one of your meeting asap. Also I want to ask is there any recruiter in this group. I'd appreciate it if you could share the open positions with me! Please feel free to connect with me! Thanks.
"Not in town all the time - But please keep me posted, connect with me. Thank You"
"Wow, so many girls that can actually code!! I am so excited, I live in Florida though, but I can't wait to go to one of your meetings! It has to be a lot of fun!"
Yay!
"The last one was so fun, I'm definitely in!"
Lightening talks a my favorite events!
"I just found this ""how to learn javascript properly"" learning roadmap, which looks really interesting and seems to be well-recommended. I'm going to take a look at it, if anyone else wants to join in! :-) http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/"
I've been looking at that too. Seems interesting.
I've been checking that out too; think I'm going to give it a serious shot. If anyone wants to do a study group following that path drop me a line!
"I'm interested in checking this out! Awesome, thanks for the find Alice!"
"I'm currently working on completing the ""web fundamentals"" series on codecademy, as per the recommendations. 

Trying to decide which of the two beginner books I should get. I'm leaning toward ""Professional Javascript for Web Developers""... just hoping that my 1 semester CS 101 counts as ""at least a bit of programming experience."""
"PS - ""JavaScript: The Definitive Guide"" is the recommended book for no programming experience. Both are linked there as part of the beginners' track."
May I please borrow a laptop? :)
I'm really sorry something urgent comes up.
"I can't make it tonight, see you next week!"
Sounds like fun.
I'm afraid I can't make it as I'm on leave until the 14th. See you at the Chef Summit.
"It was great to meet all of you at the meetup! Apologies for not posting this information earlier, but here's the discount code for Velocity NY that I mentioned:
USRG will get you 20% off any registration package.

Feel free to drop me a line or leave a comment if you have any questions.

Cheers!

"My pleasure, I had fun.  I hope everyone enjoyed ."
"Sorry guys, had meetings come up!"
Hi!  Do you have bike parking or could I bring my bike in the building?
You can bring your bike in the building and leave it just outside the entrance to our office when we go up where it will be safe (on the 6th floor).
Great! Thanks!
"Big regrets -- won't make it to the city tonight.  See you on-line.

Thanks to Colt, Peter, Sean, Google, Udacity, and all the students who helped make this great. 

Behind on my game entry -- we'll see if I make it."
Sorry you could not make it Doug. Good news:  the contest deadline was extended to this Monday 4/15.
"Great finish to a great course. Thank you Colt, Peter, and Sean!!!"
Excellent event! Where/when can we find the videos?
"I got 9 videos on my camera -- I'm not sure how many videos the other camera was able to pick up. I'll process and edit them this weekend, and then we should put them up on the WWC youtube. I'll post here when we do."
"I have a couple on my camera and a few on my phone. There were 1 or 2 talks we missed due to technical difficulties, so apologies to those folks!"
This was so great!!!
I had fun!
"Hi everyone! Thanks for an awesome lightning talk event, these are always my favorite at WWC :)

Here's the info I promised about Startup Product Summit. More info is at http://startupproduct.com, and you can register at https://startupproduct.ticketbud.com/summit. The discount code ""sfproducttalks"" will get you $50 off the Innovator ticket.

We're also partnering with Developer Week, which takes place Feb 1-7, to get you 20% off their event.

And as I mentioned, if you want to attend but aren't sure you can afford it, shoot me an email at [masked] and we can work something out. I really love this community and just want to see you guys there!"
:D
Great ! So many different speakers talking about various aspects of being a software engineer.
"Cool, varied, welcoming, relevant to newbies yet with some technical tips"
I might be driving in for this event. Does anyone know where I can get parking (paid/unpaid: either works fine) ?
I've always been able to find street parking within a block or two.
"Street parking is free after 6pm, and easy pickings on Mission between 6:00 and 6:30."
Thanks!
Carina - what's the format of the talks? I know ignite talks for example require 20 slides displayed for 20 seconds. Should we prepare slides for this event? Or spoken word only?
"The format of this is you have 5 minutes. You can do whatever you like with those 5 mins, slides or not, auto-advance or not. Most women make slides and advance them manually."
"great, thanks!"
"I would love to see what the other talks are going to be, beforehand!"
"Thanks for the nudge, Liz.  Done :-)"
I am feeling a bit under the weather and won't be able to attend.  Hopefully I will be able to make it next time.
"Hope you feel better! Get some rest, tea, and all those good things. See you next time!"
"We're looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday for lightning talks!  If you're planning to talk, please sign up at http://bit.ly/TLgiaW so we can hold a timeslot for you (and give you a nice intro to the audience). :-)

P.S. Does anyone have a video camera you can bring? Recordings of our previous talks have been very appreciated.  We'd love to do it again."
my SLR can record HD video but I've never used it to record a long event (not sure if it would fit on a 32GB SD). I'll bring it and you can use it if you don't find a real video cam before then.
"Thanks, Michelle.  That sounds great. The talks are 5 minutes, so no worries about long event time.  If the SD fills, we'll improvise with a phone or something."
Can boys attend?
"Women Who Code is for folks who identify as women, so no go."
Who's on the scheudule so far?
Thank you ladies for hosting this great event- definitely looking forward to attending more in the future :)
"It was great to see & meet so many women entrepreneurs, developers hacking away... would love to attend more of these in the south bay!"
"Rachel: It was great to meet you too! We'd love to have you lead a breakout group, look to an email from us soon.

Grace: We're having a holiday party in mid-December, and we hope to see you there!"
"I wasn't able to attend, but would love to stay posted on the next one! Thanks for putting this together!"
"Thanks Nikila, Jennie and Anisha for organizing this - I had a ton of fun talking to you all! Also, if you need help organizing any of the breakout coding groups, please let me know. I'm happy to help out."
Jacqueline: absolutely! Beginners welcome. See you there.
Sounds like a great event! Is it also open to women who don't know how to code/program but are looking to learn??

"Yes, I think we should be able post slides tomorrow."
Would really like to go to this please cancel if you are not going to make it.
"I just cancelled because I will have already left for PyCon on sunday. So hopefully you or someone else can take my spot! I'm bummed that I'm going to miss it too, because it looks like a great talk."
"Just saw that we have grown to 200-strong from a few brave people a couple of months back. It is great to see the community growing! ...and this is just in London. 
Thanks for making the community what it is. See you at the next one!"
Thanks Boyan :)

This Fest was very informative! Can someone please post the link to the slides here.Thank you!
Amazing fest cant wait for this next year 😄
"Can hardly wait to attend next year. Having it on a Friday was great. Though, I would have preferred it was later in the year."
anyone selling the ticket??! I’m willing to buy the ticket. :)
Will bringing a laptop be beneficial?
"I usually bring a laptop to take high level notes. Honestly a pen and notebook usually would suffice too.

My recommendation is if this is your first time at a conference bring your laptop and see how it works out."
Awesome! First time for sure. So a fully charged laptop it is.
I was one of those people who were late to buy the tickets. If anyone is not going and want to sell their tickets please let me know. Thanks
If anyone can't go and can sell me their ticket please let me know ty

"Hello. What should we install for the CodeLab on our laptops? More generally, what prereqs would the CodeLab involve?

Thanks!

- Frank Solomon"
Hi Frank. Great question. I would suggest having either Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA installed.
Yup! James is totally right. If you have Android Studio 3.3+ installed you should be good to go.
Will this be live streamed?
"We look forward to see you all today. We will have Pizza and drinks, so come early for some networking :-)"
I'd like to attend the speaker talks- am wondering if the codelabs/workshops are helpful to beginners ?
I cannot attend tomorrow.  How do I free up my spot for someone on the waitlist?
"Hey William, thanks for letting us know. Since you have updated your RSVP, we are all good. :)"
Hey folks! Remember to RSVP here: https://slackcommunity.com/events/details/slack-san-francisco-presents-chrome-dev-summit-extended-2019/#/
Really excited to come to come to this event.
I also have to pass... still recovering from surgery.
Hey Sherry - We have multiple codelabs and you will be able to do the one which is closer to your experience level.
Bummed I can't attend this afterall. I cancelled up my spot for someone else. See you next time!
"As promised here is the SlideShare link to the presentation slides:
https://www.slideshare.net/ocampesato/introduction-to-tensorflow-2-and-keras"
Thank you it will be nice to go over the basic syntax and such. A great introduction lecture!
"Many thanks everyone who attended, and if this was your first exposure to RNNs and LSTMs it was probably overwhelming, but speaking from my own experience, I can say that if you persist you will prevail=:)"
"I've tried three times to upload the presentation slides to SlideShare but to no avail, so I'll try again tomorrow;("
Will this be live streamed?
Any update on Venue? Hopefully in SF.
Walk in the market St entrance. Look for the table that says Microsoft and get checked in.
Hi! Is there instructions of how to get to the Microsoft offices of this large building. Thanks!
"It turns out I can’t make it, will this be recorded?"
"No, this will not be recorded. :-( We are going to do our best to live tweet it under the hashtag #DevRelPanel if you want to follow along on Twitter."
Thanks! Sorry I can’t make it. Really wish there was some way to teleport myself to SF to be there on time 😜
Will there be any bike parking for this event? Is it ok to bring bikes up? If the freight elevator is closed what is the protocol?
"Hi, is there a recording for this event? I worked directly in this domain and it's too bad I missed it"
+1
Hi is this GOOGLE Event for beginners or only  intermediate and advanced people doing coding or design?
Only if you are a 10x Dev and a design master so pretty much a Unicorn I’d say ;)
There is a bit of credible and hands-on information... https://www.haikuforteams.com/learn/
"Unfortunately I can’t make it as we have a team dinner, if it will be recorded love to see the video."
All levels are welcome!

It's in two days and there are no details."
Good start.  Great opportunity to meet other Gophers.  The Talks were a nive taste of things to come.
Do spouses need to be on the list too for the kick off party?
"Any gophers around DTC or south denver ? I would love meet and explore golang. 

Anand"
"Hope everybody has fun! A little bummed that I'm missing GopherCon 2016, but will be up in the mountains on a family retreat...

(Maybe I'll have to take my laptop and have a mini-con by myself to the annoyance of my extended family.)"
Anyone have a lead on extra tickets for the conference? Didn't think I'd be in town but plans changed and now I'd love to attend Gophercon
Any chance someone here might be pulling out and has available tickets I could purchase?

"It's in the eingang between Thalia and Muller, go in and then on the left side, first door."
Is the address correct? Passed by Maria-Hilfer 97 earlier today and haven't seen Meisterlabs' sign. Also Gmaps thinks it's somewhere else.
I hope MeisterLabs will have some stickers? My laptop just pinged me that it needs few more
"Thanks everyone who came and listened to me talk about SyncMachine! I hope you all found it interesting. SyncMachine can be found at https://github.com/fhwang/sync_machine, and I'm on Twitter at @fhwang."
"Is this event likely to finish promptly at 8:30? I'm in town from Portland and have an overlapping company engagement, but in the interest of PDX.rb/NYC.rb intercoastal relations it would be great to stop in and say hello, even if only for a short while."
Hi again. Thanks for all of that great info! But I'm not going to make it this time; my apologies for the last-minute cancellation.
The door is on Vancouver Street.   It's a glass door located between Whole Bowl and Bread & Honey.  Take the elevator up to Planet Argon and it's the first door on the left.
Hi. Where is the best place to park?
"What goes on at these ""Ruby Tuesday"" events?"
"Hey Martin! It seems to work on our end, can you try again? Maybe it was like an internet thing! If not, you are welcome to message me your question or post it here so we can add it. Thanks for trying to submit a question though :) !"
"Martin, any specific errors you're getting?
Here's the link to ask questions: https://app2.sli.do/event/mva4xe6t/ask"
Thanks
Myself/employees who drive often are able to find parking somewhere along N Beech Street (either side of Williams / Vancouver) in the neighborhoods within a few blocks. Would suggest a street north of Fremont
"Usually there's some social time with pizza from 6-7, then a talk or two."

We're having a Karaoke meetup on 19th!
コメントありがとうございます！他のイベントもこれからアクティブに行なっていく予定ですので、今後違うイベントでお会いできることを楽しみにしております！
Today I got out little bit late. Hope to join the next one
Unfortunately I had a long 11 hours travel starting at 4am [one of the aspects of DevRel life 😉] and I miss the meetup tonight 😫
I'm on my way!
Unfortunately my meeting is over running and I wont be able to attend.
"Also, my organization, The Knowledge House, provides free technology courses in the Bronx. We are currently partnering with Hostos Community College to teach a FREE Usability Testing Certificate program. If you would like to know more about this opportunity please feel free to reach out to me at dtagoe@theknowledgehouse.org."
It was a great opportunity to learn about what developers are working on.
Inspiring presentations that opened my eyes to what can be built. Enjoyed the food and swag. A Saturday very well spent. Thanks to all the organizers. Let me know where I can fill out that survey.
Did the change the date?. I had a reminder message that it was 6.20 but it was 6.19 and I did go ad I wanted to meet some friends in Berkeley after 9 pm .... so I had 3 hours in my hands
"Progressive Web Apps, Tenserflow 2.0, pizza, drinks and a wonderful networking time tonight! See you all soon!!"
"GDG Berkeley would like to thank once again our amazing speakers Igor Franca and Eric Wendel for coming all the way from Brazil to present their cool and informative talks! You two are welcome to our community always!

Don’t forget that anyone can sign up to present a technical topic they are passionate about, to share knowledge and exchange ideas!"
Is this a good event for asking peers for help integrating an app with Google Play Services?
"I'm inclined to say no, not that I'd tell you that you can't/shouldn't. We just normally don't handle mobile text, so I couldn't speak to the strength of our members."
I'm late. Will reach in 20 min. How much will I miss
"No worries, Johnny! This is a self-paced course, so you can stop by when you can."
"Hey Everybody ! I will be there tonight to help mentor with projects or speed-bumps in your learning. I'll be recruiting for our Berkeley-based startup, Taxnexus.net!"
"We look forward to having you tonight, Vernon! Welcome to GDG Berkeley ☺"
"Unfortunately, the original venue changed their commitment very last minute. Our team was lucky to find PSR on such a short notice. We hope to see you today, Howard."
"Looks like the address changed.  I thought this was originally at Dharma College, 2222 Harold Way, Berkeley.  Not so close to BART now.  Its about 3/4s of a mile, up hill at the end."
Many thanks to Michael and the attentive audience!-:)
"As promised, here's the link to the slides:
https://www.slideshare.net/ocampesato/deep-learning-in-your-browser"
I'm looking forward to meeting all of you in just a few weeks! It'll be a great time of discussion as well as an introduction to this concept of DevRel or Community Qualified Leads.
"Hey everyone!! Looking forward to seeing you all at the meetup :). Please post any questions in the comments and I'll be happy to answer them ✨✨ 

(as a side note, please take this time to check that you RSVP'd with your full name!)"
"I was wondering why this meet up is still active and realized this is a long event :)

The presentation used for the meet up https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14IjHz4I-ystgY95Hw2HN9ZoK8JTZs0mRXNF5ynwNOd8/edit?usp=sharing"
Is this about the Connected Citizens Program for Waze?
"Hello etiosa, thanks for your interest in our event. Unfortunately, we will not be able to confirm anyone for this event due to space constraints. We extremely sorry for this inconvenience and hope to see you for our future events."
Thanks for an excellent presentation last night! Looking forward to learning more.

if anybody is going to event this Saturday from North San Jose then I would like to car pool if space is available.
"I haven't quite kicked this flu or whatever I have, so to avoid spreading it to the rest of you fine folks I think I'm going to stay at home. Sad to miss the talk, but hope you all have fun!"
"Nooooo.. I was really looking forward to seeing you. Next time, feel better."
"Apologies, we will need to reschedule this talk one more time. Thanks for your patience!"
"It’s been moved already once after no response from the organizer, I doubt it’ll be this week."
Is this event still happening? And will there be a location?
There is more demand each year and the number of slots the GDG gets from Google may be less.
Just a few years ago we went to a Google site to register for the I/O NY Event. Now we're directed to sign-up on meetup and wait as a filter is applied
"With Respect to IO at Mountain View or Satellite live IO events at Google Offices, we are not involved in their selection process and we don't have any event place holder. Please don't do personalized attacks. I don't recollect ever meeting you at our GDG meetup's but if you have any concerns please visit our upcoming meetup and feel free to express your concern."
Thanks Erik -- appreciate it :-)
"Thanks so much everyone. I had a great time, and it was nice to meet all of you. I look forward to the next one!"
Oh wow. Totally blanked on this. UGH! Sorry gang :(
We spent most of the hour staring at the seat where you normally sit. Carter had to lie down for a bit.
:D
Great ! So many different speakers talking about various aspects of being a software engineer.
"Cool, varied, welcoming, relevant to newbies yet with some technical tips"
I might be driving in for this event. Does anyone know where I can get parking (paid/unpaid: either works fine) ?
I've always been able to find street parking within a block or two.
"Street parking is free after 6pm, and easy pickings on Mission between 6:00 and 6:30."
Can boys attend?
"I need to defend myself here. {:

The ""Prisoner approved"" deployment method is ""whatever you are familiar with"". Unlike other platforms (ahem) which STRONGLY encourage you to use their serverless platform, Google really does let you run anywhere in whatever language you're familiar with.

They have some additional support if you're using node.js in either their environment, or with express.js (which their environment uses behind the scenes)... but if you want to use Java on your personal server, .NET on Azure, or whatever you want on AWS... go for it!

Most of my work I do with Firebase Functions because its easy, but I've run test environments without Firebase, and some of my projects are on AWS Lambda."
"Sorry, couldnt join you guys. Weather :/"
Omw... Happy Holidays Y'all!
"Sorry guys, I won't be able to make it this time. Happy Holidays to everyone!"
Thank you everyone who rsvp'd to our Google Cloud Platform Meetup this month. The details have been finalized and a set date of February 22nd at 6 p.m. has been decided. We look forward to seeing you then!
"No, no, unfortunately we're not involved in that and I just realized there is a typo. It should be GCP (Google Cloud Platform)."
Inspiring presentations that opened my eyes to what can be built. Enjoyed the food and swag. A Saturday very well spent. Thanks to all the organizers. Let me know where I can fill out that survey.
Wonderful event as always! Learned a lot 😀
I gave a workshop on AR Object Tracking for NYCMediaLab a couple of weeks ago. I could do a recap
Thanks for the quick reply and fix.
"Hey guys I can’t make it today , anyone feel free to take my spot ! Thanks !!"
Did the location change? My name had been provided Sergei Khramtsov-Templar
Skyler will help you create a Pong game on Scratch at 3:30pm in Room 227.

How wonderful to see so many women coders in one room!
"Thank you for inviting me, had a great time! Here are Sentinel's slides with links to all its HW and SW components. https://goo.gl/CvK7ZQ"
"We're bummed you won't be here either (we're super bummed to miss CMX)-- maybe we can find someone to film it this time. If you've got any burning questions you think they should answer, let me know."
DevFest 2017 was amazing. Special thanks to the Organizers and Panelist. I look forward to the next one.
I would like to say thank you to all speakers who took the time out to share their amazing passions/projects/work and to the organizers for hosting this fantastic event. I learned a lot and look forward to participating more in the future.
So fun! I learned a lot
"Thanks to the organizers, attendees, and other speakers for a great DevFest! Was great talking to many of you, and I hope to work with many of you as you develop some awesome actions. My slides are currently available at http://prisoner.com/ubi/, and I hope to have video from the event soon."
Great event!  Looking forward to seeing you all again!
What a great and informative session. Awesome job and Thanks to each Presenter and the GDG Bronx Organizers - zurcjoe.
It was an awesome experience. I learned a lot of things and I was inspired by a lot of the speakers.
A nice time was had by all
Very good.
Big thanks to our hosts for a great event. I thought I posted a link to my slides. I don't see it. (Have I mentioned I hate the android meetup app? ) JIC here it is http://tinyurl.com/y7wadltv
It was pretty fun! Food was good and the speakers were fantastic!
"Great topics, I loved the presentations and learned a lot about each presenter. Thank you Eva, Hendrix and nelmer for this wonderful event!"
It was cool!
"This Meetup was great, I loved all of the presentations and the innovative projects they were working on. I was introduced to great tools I didn't know we're available."
"running a little late, but will be there shortly!"
"Rachel: It was great to meet you too! We'd love to have you lead a breakout group, look to an email from us soon.

Grace: We're having a holiday party in mid-December, and we hope to see you there!"
"I wasn't able to attend, but would love to stay posted on the next one! Thanks for putting this together!"
"Hello thanks for the welcome, excited to be part of this group."
"Those are odd hours, but I'm inclined to find out more."
"Well those hours are definitely not right, but it will hopefully be a day or two..."
Do we have to register via skills matter as we as attending on here?
"Hi Steven, please do. I know its a bit of a pain, but Skills Matter prefer that folks sign up on their site when we use their facilities."
Can we discuss topics for unconferencing at CLS West?
"Wow, so many girls that can actually code!! I am so excited, I live in Florida though, but I can't wait to go to one of your meetings! It has to be a lot of fun!"
Yay!
"The last one was so fun, I'm definitely in!"

The slides https://speakerdeck.com/nacx/continuous-integration-before-and-after-chef
Great presentation and funny introduction - ;). Thanks for delighting us with your experiences and expertise.
Thanks Xavier!
The more you say there's no commercial intention the less I believe you :)
I promise you! I am a technical guy and I repeat this because I don't like presentations where someone is selling his product if it wasn't the intention of the presentation :). But believe me! There is no commercial intention ;)
Haha.
Jacqueline: absolutely! Beginners welcome. See you there.
Hey Carlos .. I sent email out earlier this afternoon to everyone who was registered prior to that time. Did you just register today? If not check your email/spam  - else let me know.
I submitted a form today for my team but not sure if I have to call.  The form confirmation says 'Call for Participation'.  Thanks!
"Nope. You should be good. CFP is a general term to indicate we are still taking applications.

I will send next set of reminders in Nov. Do register for our Nov 6 event .. more updates will be sent around Nov 1"
Can't attend. I will be out of town.
"Yes, depend on it!! I will be doing a talk on Firestore at another conference in mid-Nov so will do a shorter version here."
"Yes. Since I don't have as much bandwidth to micromanage RSVPs I am going to rely on the honor code -- if you RSVP, please do your best to show up (or cancel at least 12 hrs before event). That's all I ask 😁

The amount of time taken to organize events, gather resources, collect names, print badges & track no shows is non-trivial - so hope the community can help out by being responsible on RSVPs."
Looks like we will be waitlisted by default and get a confirmation later.
"You will get added to the waitlist by default  & get confirmed closer to the date. We will prioritize folks who get selected for AppFest, but will try to accommodate as many others as possible as well"
"Thanks JF, yes, let's chat then. Best wishes, MO"

http://www.slideshare.net/mr_chip/whats-new-in-chef-12

http://www.slideshare.net/mr_chip/infrastructure-modeling-with-chef

Let me know if you have any questions about the content!"
"Note: it is not mandatory to participate in the Hackathon - but why would you not want to? :-)  Click that link to understand requirements.

All participants get a free ticket to Day 2 of DevFest (and all its swag) plus a subsidized ticket to Day 1 (tech talks). Plus the Firebase team will be sending engineers to help mentor and judge the winning apps. It's a chance to do something fun & productive. 

Plus - Dec 3 marks the start of CSEdWeek - consider this your official completion of the HourOfCode :-)"
Sorry I missed you last night. Perhaps we can speak on the phone or via email? It's mo.dealondon@gmail.com
I signed up when this was first mentioned.  Will we get an email notification or something about the details of the event?
Thoroughly enjoyed it.
Hey Carlos .. I sent email out earlier this afternoon to everyone who was registered prior to that time. Did you just register today? If not check your email/spam  - else let me know.
Was wondering if the talks tonight are going to be videoed?
I submitted a form today for my team but not sure if I have to call.  The form confirmation says 'Call for Participation'.  Thanks!
"Hi John, yes Skills Matter record all the sessions. We post the link here once the process it. Thanks."
"Nope. You should be good. CFP is a general term to indicate we are still taking applications.

I will send next set of reminders in Nov. Do register for our Nov 6 event .. more updates will be sent around Nov 1"
"Any chance Cloud Firestore will be discussed? I understand it is pretty new, and there may not be sufficient time to add it to the agenda."
"Late to the party, Firebase Camp is still open?"
"John, the videos are posted here https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6565-chef-users-london-october-meetup"
No it's not full. We are waitlisting folks and confirming them closer to the event. Applicants for AppFest (Hackathon) will be prioritized
Slides from my talk are now online at http://www.slideshare.net/zts/cookbook-ci-with-jenkins
"AppFest 2017 - Call for Participation is now open
http://bit.ly/appfestNY-cfp-2017"
I love to see our community booming and so sorry I missed yesterday! Please join us for the next one. Guess we'll have to have a Christmas special too... Hopefully see as many of you as possible at Summit @ Westminster Hub next week.
"Is this Firebase camp really full already, or is that also being confirmed later?"
"Well done, Mike, glad you built that!"
Have I missed something? The talks tonight are not about chef???
Is there a list of the people who gave presentations ?  Looking to connect.
I attended ones by David Bland & David Binetti. Maybe we can start a list. I'll ask Nick.
"""The actual conference sharply deviated from the proposed venue where a group of people participate equally in finding solutions to difficult issues."" <- Perhaps a peer group would be a better format for this? Just asking, since I feel as though a lot of people find this meetup valuable."
"My comments were not directed at what might be perceived by some as valuable. The  product description for the event itself was not what was provided. If my expectation had been set to be a series of presentations by lean startup individuals with requested feedback, this venue may have satisfied me, although I doubt I would have gone.  Rather, the item being sold was, ""collaborative problem solving"". Also, having an impression that something is valuable and it actually being valuable, converting knowledge into traction, are two separate issues. This is one of the principles of lean, which is to measure effectiveness."
"Updated links:

Thanks.
"Thanks for your feedback Philip. As we run more and more UnConferences, we are getting better about promoting open discussion topics as opposed to presentations. At this month's event, there were many sessions that ran more like discussions, but it sounds like you experienced a few that did not. I'd love to talk more about your experience if you have time next week. Let me know if you'd be interested and I can contact you directly through meetup to schedule a call."
I find the smaller sessions are much more interactive. The two improvements to the actual sessions I would like to implement are: 1) making it clear what the format of the session is when they are proposed and 2) Have volunteer facilitators that can work with people with topics but no experience.
So bummed to miss this. Glad everyone enjoyed it!
"Five stars, thanks for all the feedback on the game!"
Great meetup! This event was organized well and the sessions were invaluable.
Love the unConference!
Great sessions
"I'll be there too, giving a lightning talk about doing user testing for a physical product :-)"
I'll actually make this one!
"So bummed to miss this. Have fun, everyone!"
I'll be there!
"They were upstairs, buddy. They had beer and pizza too. The testing seminar downstairs wado good too."
"What about the main event this week? I can't find info anywhere, too late for RSVP?"
I really enjoyed this meetup because of the quality of participants and speakers. Looking forward to many more!
"Awesome event. Great speakers, amazing crowd, fantastic dialog."
If a meetup I am hosting happens on a *different* night I will attend!
"Do you need ideas for locations?
Coffee shops often do not have room for this large a group, but chain restaurants such as Denny's and IHop can accommodate us, in my experience."
thanks for the great ideas Bill. I didnt know about Denny's or IHop doing that - very good to know. We only have 12 confirmed people for the Dec 12 event. Just waiting to get confirmation that I can get the venue I'd like. Thanks again!
"Anyone else attending deal with being handed a community that has a tremendous amount of negativity? I don't mean the ordinary ""I don't like the changes to the product,"" I mean I woke up on Christmas to death threats.  It doesn't really faze me, but I'd love to connect around strategies with others who are working in this situation.  

I will try to make CM Breakfast, but it's very hard for me to come because I have a 10 AM SHARP office-wide meeting in Oakland every Tuesday."
"Hey Katherine, I'm working with something similar to that. Feel free to message me, or tweet met at @samhouston so that we can connect :) I'd be happy to talk about this with you and hear your thoughts too."
"I'm in the same boat (with timing and meetings out of SF). Anyway to join the discussion virtually?

I don't have a negative community but they are skeptical, so I'm sure there's a certain amount of negativity there. (However, certainly no death threats! omg!)"
"I would be open to starting an informal community manager meetup in Oakland on some other morning, Jo. Don't know where you're commuting to."
@Henry. You misunderstand. These people don't want to kill us because of changes to our product; they want to kill us essentially because they've had a bad run of luck in a game that has a luck component.
@katherine: I commute to SJ. :(
Looks like #cmgrchat today (happening in 10 minutes) is about a very similar topic. Head to www.tweetchat.com and type in #cmgrchat to join!
"Um, not in a while, but I do have a body guard budget now. LOL!"
"This meetup was great!

Thanks so much to Chef Meetup Group and Ooyala for putting this on.

I'm from Telmate in San Francisco and Chef has really made our lives workable, and supporting more and more nodes possible as we scale our systems and services.  This kind of information and future suggested direction really helps us plan what to focus on and how to structure our DEV, QA and Production architecture to keep improving and meeting our automation  goals.

We're always looking for talent also, so if you are looking for a change - please look at Telmate.  Drop me a line if interested."
Hi can someone plz send your contact number to my email just in case i can'r find the group? tt.joyce@gmail.com  many thanks and i love dogs!
I'd be interested in a ride. Would you have room for 2?
"yup, I do. can you guys meet me near Filbert & Laguna?"
"Thanks for the offer. I may not be able to make this meetup after all, so if I do I can just take the bus so as not to keep you waiting."
"k, hope to see you out there!"
"Hey Mary, 

We have had dogs on our runs before, no problem!"
"thanks, Zach!"
"any objections if i bring my dog along? he's friendly, and we run-splore GG Park together on a regular basis."
"Sarge - he would definitely be on a leash! he's small, and very friendly,but I'll be sure to keep my distance if he makes you nervous!"
ok i'll take public transit. can someone leave a contact number just in case i cant find the group? thx
"Joyce- This will be a rain or shine event! 

Sarge- No worries Sarge. Feel free to show up and run as much as you can. Also, you would be suprised how much farther you can run when running in a group, the miles will fly by!

Transportation- I will be driving over from the NoPa area, so if anyone needs a ride let me know!

Thanks, 
Zach"
yay! agreed on the flying part! yay!
i live in soma. 500 beale. is it on the way?
is this rain or shine?
I'd love to learn how Mad Eye is doing application level testing
We just published a blog post on the subject.  http://blog.madeye.io/2013/02/testing-meteor-here-at-madeye-were-big.html  Check it out and let us know what you think.
Thank you!
"I had a blast! Thanks, everyone, for coming out! Can't wait for the next round of lightning talks."
Hope this event gets recorded!
coming right up
"Outstanding first event. Looking forward to future events as the community grows and develops. Great food and drink, and the lightning talks were a wonderful idea for people to participate in the community in a friendly, low-pressure format."
"The staff was wonderful and very personable.  The hospitality was great.  Jade is a personality of another order: absolutely awesome energy. | I met other Meteorites, with whom hopefully collab."
Someone left their notebook here! :( It's sitting on my desk if you want to come by to pick it up.
"Is it a long, thin 'spiral' notebook?"
"Haven't been able to come for a while, but will be glad to be back!"
"Oh noes! Sad! Now that I work in Menlo Park, I'm afraid I won't be able to attend the wonderful breakfast as often :( Please tweet so I can follow online!"
Excited to get back into the conversation.
Looking forward to the breakfast!
Looking forward to it!
An awesome time as always! And here you go: http://twitter.com/herbietlpug and http://facebook.com/herbiethelovepug. Follow and like my massive pug Herbie.
It was great! A lot was covered from ambassador programs to email outreach.
Wish I could've gone but a work meeting got pushed up. Hope to be able to attend next time!
"My theme tomorrow will be ""IRL FTW"". Can't wait!"
I will finally come to a CM breakfast so Evan doesn't hate me and also I love CM breakfasts!
"Aw, I would never hate you for not coming to breakfast. :)"
I have a lot of guilt.
"We get Sarah-Jane, Meghan, and Thomas? Tomorrow's gonna bef un. :)"
"""be fun"", even. #needcaffeine"
"gosh I really really wish I could discuss this topic with you, this is so timely for me. Unfortunately, I have a contract gig that starts early in the morning that morning! Best of luck! :("
Good luck with the gig! We'll try to post notes.
"Thanks everyone for the great evening! I had a blast, it was really fun.

For the slide deck, check out https://speakerdeck.com/ariya/javascript-need-for-speed."
Just a reminder that Glassdoor is looking for a talented web developer to join our growing startup. http://www.glassdoor.com/about/careers.htm
I was really surprised at how many pretty girls want to learn javascript optimization.
That's not an appropriate thing to post
"Good presentation, good pizza and interesting folks. Loved it!"
"Thanks for the great presentation, would be great if you could share the presentation file."
"Sorry guys, had meetings come up!"

"Hi Nicole, in light of your talk last night, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on http://www.archetypecss.com/ ...?"
Nicole is great! I second the question about slides and recording? That would be awesome :P
"Nicole is brilliant, knows her subject and very able to present and share her experience. Big thanks to Yelp for hosting such large gathering."
"Great talk! Full of content and cutting-edge CSS, a time well invested!

Great venue as well, congrats to the organizers!"
Awesome presentation! Really helped show what my organization could do better.
"Good talk! Went on a little over on time so not much QA times, but that's what twitter is for. :)"
Awesome talk! Wondering if the slides and recording are available. =)

Thanks once again! I passed out the remaining passes in the first ten minutes of the Seattle Tech Meetup the following evening. Much appreciated!
I am a new comer. Anyone could provide a ride from Factorial Mall?
"Hi Shaojun. If you know how to park around the meetup place, I'd like to pick u up."
"Thanks for picking me up. There are definitely parking meters we can use. It might be that we can find free parking at night, but I am not sure."
Sounds cool. What's your mobile number? I will call you when I am around.
"Sorry, Jeff. I missed your message. See you guys next time."
Is this definitely a 21 and over event :/
"Unfortunately, yes, this is at a bar, and they only allow 21+ in."
"I might be interested in coming, is RSVP a requirement?  Is there any open source web developers?  I am planning on writing web business type of software and have been a .NET developer for most of my life; however, I am interested in finding alternatives to Microsoft technologies and would be interested to learn more about options in the open source world."
"I might make it but to be safe and avoid getting tagged as a ""no-show"" I'm changing my RSVP."
I am new to Seattle. Does anyone know where may be a good spot to park the car? Thanks!
"I cant make it now, but looking forward to the next event!"
Anyone from easy side and would like to carpool?
"Interesting overview of Simian Army and the philosophy behind it.  Good quality food, plentiful beer, nice location, good crowd."
"Great presos, great food, great people!"

Both very good talks. Thanks for the meetup.

Great stuff Jon! Got a lot of good take aways from the talk. Thank you for putting it together.
"I could do a talk on Puppet.  I am not a master yet, but have been using it for some time now."
"Joh, we're looking to fill September.  You interested in putting something together for that month?  I'd love to get some local talent speaking in addition to bringing in outside people.  This is supposed to be all about local tech people getting together and discussing technologies after all."
"Yes, I would be more than happy to."
Haha hey dude!! It is? I'm sure it's yours! ;) Next time!!
"Yes, I am using Puppet in master/client mode, as well as workstation management with the Puppet agent in masterless mode.  As far as Chef, I am not well versed in and just started learning it.   I picked Puppet for the DSL, and it was really what I was reading about at the time and fell in love with it."
Which OSes do you use puppet on? I mainly use it on OS X.
"Linux, OS X, and Windows"
"Excellent. I manage OS X only at the moment, with a linux node or two at home just for fun."
"If your not a master, are you using Puppet Master daemon. Do you have any comparisons to Chef as to why you picked Puppet instead ?"
This topic definitely has some interest but it needs a speaker.  Is there anyone interested in providing a talk on this subject?  We're looking for something for September at this point.
"I've used Puppet for OS X Server configuration, but I do not have any experience with Chef.  I think this would definitely make for an interested discussion."
Is this something you'd be interested in presenting on with your experiences?
"Not yet, but perhaps in the future.  I am not amazing at puppet right now and I've definitely not used it for managing linux servers.  I hope to be using Puppet 3.x and some Linux servers in the near future though."
Interesting topic & one we've been through here at AWeber.  I think we could probably make this happen & provide some input on the topic!
"am running a bit later than i'd hoped, but i'll be there soon!"
"Rats, I'm too far away. I will be out next month, but visiting is high on my list."
Sorry I have to stay late for a new project at the office. Hope to meet everyone at the next event.
"Shucks, my sitter canceled on me. I hope you'll have another hack night soon."
"Bummer! We will have one next month, so we'll see you then."
I will definitely be there.
My baby sick ... can't attend ... next time ... :'(
"Oh no, we'll be sending over some feel better and get well soon thoughts!"
Can't wait ... got a new project ...
GREAT!!!
"Something came up... happy hacking, ladies!"
Can't wait ... got a new project ...
Decent overview of recently announced services. Looking forward to trying out cloudtrail.
Lightening talks a my favorite events!
"I'll be at the Docker hackday, as well.  bummer."
Wish I could make this one but it's on the same day as the next Docker hackday.
Yey thanks a lot!
Yay!
Thanks a million!!
Kyle rocked my socks.
"Thanks Kyle,  great talk. BTW Laurie is a dude."
AH crap! Sorry @lozzd !
"Great talk, perfect level of technical detail!  Can't wait for the slides and video to send coworkers who couldn't attend.  Thanks!"
Lots of good information and discussioin
"It was great to meet a few of you last night, and thanks for the great presentation, Kyle! Here's the discount for Velocity that I mentioned: SFDEVOPS20 will get you 20% off any registration package. For more information, go to http://oreil.ly/Q6cftW"
A very technical discussion skillfully presented in a clear and engaging manner.
+1 Yes very good presentation.  Thanks Kyle for talking and Yelp for hosting. Well done.
"That was a presentation well worth attending.  Looking forward to the slides and video.  Also, a question I thought after the presentation.  I noticed ethernet taps and ipads attached to the taps, I wondered if they had monitoring for temp or ""keg remaining"", and if so, were they still on the legacy nagios system, or had been migrated to sensu.  :)"
"Thanks everyone for coming! Stay tuned for the video of tonight's presentation- the link will be up in the next couple of days. In the meantime, submit talks of your own if you've got a story to tell!"
See you all tomorrow!
"Should I not show up if I question why bother when you can use Puppet to automake a dynamic Icinga+pnp4nagios infrastructure, with actively developed off-the-shelf puppet modules from Github? :)"
"Being that your personal http://www.boldandbusted.com/ Web site doesn't even return any data, perhaps it's time for you to consider trying some new monitoring tools.  ;)"
Sweet. There's my answer.
"Well, that is one answer I guess? 

A different answer, is that Sensu's architecture allows for *really* dynamic checks, to empower self-service and real time ephemeral EC2 monitoring. 

While I won't be comparing Sensu to other tools in this talk, hopefully it will be obvious when you see it, you will be like, ""Oh, Nagios can't really do that."""
"Hi everyone,

Sorry for the delay - the videos from the London DevOps Meetup #2 are now online at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-JvSFEhoWGf1oSmSDMHkcJeCRkMABBbh

Still quite new to this video processing lark, so please let us know what you think, both about the videos and the meetup in general.

Hope to see you at the next one - at moo.com on Thursday 13th November.  I'm off to buy some cookie ingredients now. :)"
Hey guys. You can find the slides from my talk here: http://www.slideshare.net/nathariel/monitoring-microservices-platform-40373428

"Someone was asking about dependency visualization:
http://structure101.com for Java, .NET, and others
http://www.ndepend.com for .NET
http://www.jarchitect.com for Java

NDepend and JArchitect are essentially the same product. They both have the classic dependency structure matrix and a dependency visualizer that i am not fond of. They also have a query language that should allow us to query properties of our jar files/assemblies. This feature sounds cool but I have not used it.

Structure 101 has a great UI and restructuring (like refactoring but different) facilities that are out of this world. Be sure to watch the videos. I am just now getting started with it."
Thanks Bogdan and the rest of participants for such an interesting meeting and discussion on SRP and other SE topics.
excellent. I predict that this group is going to have some of the best events: you're not going to meet Ken Schwaber but you will get to chew on profound ideas.

I'm mostly accessible here if you want to join our community: https://bit.ly/metis-community-slack"
"thanks for a great meetup! it was a lot of fun as always, and I appreciated the spirited conversations :)"
AWESOME location. AWESOME talk. AWESOME socks.
YEAH! i have been waiting for this.
"hi everyone! It was great to meet you last night. In case the slides went by too quickly, here's the info about REdeploy:

(venue announcement coming soon!)
https://re-deploy.io
@REdeployConf

Early Bird ticket prices are good through June 30
15% off discount code: SFRE8

Hope to see you in August!"
Great
"Good question! I've asked our Microsoft hosts, and will update when I hear back."
"Yes, bikes are ok but we don’t have bike parking. There is a lot of open space where you can set a bike. 

You will have to use the service elevator. There should be a call button on the back door.

 Hope that helps!"
"@Tilde, thank you for inquiring about bikes. Your reply is very helpful. Looking forward to the event tonight :)"
Is there a topic/speaker lineup for the meetup tomorrow yet?
Hello! Could someone reach out to me directly about this event? Thanks!
"Oops, has anybody already reached out to you?"
"I did, I hope I answered Rachel's questions."
Is there coffee?

"Wow, this agenda is awesome! I am so excited to learn from and share with you all, tomorrow!"
"Hi everyone - tomorrow we will be at the F-rooms at the Convention Center. Those of us doing set up plan to be there at 8:30am, with the presentations starting at 9am.  Leave a comment with any questions."
"Hi, is there a recording for this event? I worked directly in this domain and it's too bad I missed it"
+1
Hi is this GOOGLE Event for beginners or only  intermediate and advanced people doing coding or design?
Only if you are a 10x Dev and a design master so pretty much a Unicorn I’d say ;)
There is a bit of credible and hands-on information... https://www.haikuforteams.com/learn/
"Unfortunately I can’t make it as we have a team dinner, if it will be recorded love to see the video."
All levels are welcome!
I'd love to see my video!
"I take this as a ""yes"" to posting on our YouTube channel, Pracheeti? 🎬"
sure
I had been registered but never received a confirmation. This meet up starts getting disbobulated
Ghost in a shell I assume))). Would be honored to attend and meet likeminded.
"Hi, just wondering if the talks were recorded? Any more pictures from the event? Will they be posted here?"
"Hello Pracheeti, at this time we are not recording any sessions due to certain restrictions, we are looking into it seriously as  our community is growing."
"Hi all - so Donna Cheng joined us officially as an assistant org last month, and has been doing a fantastic job taking pictures and capturing media for documenting our events.

She *might* have some video of the talks (and definitely has pictures). We are just working out the details on how to post these -  so do check back. We don't have a formal process yet but we're working on it  -- hoping to have video options for future events."
"Good afternoon, i'm a freelance multimedia journalist and writer. I would love to assist in capturing media and possibly writing/filming a recap of the sessions for the members that are interested in viewing or for those that couldn't make it.  Please let me know if I could be of any assistance to Donna or at all. Best!"
"Thanks, Sunni. If you want to volunteer to write a long recap of the speaker's presentations, that would be great. Perhaps we'll leave it open for other members to add links or comment with their experience or insights. (The limitations of the Meetup platform are showing.) Maybe we should start a blog that would link from the GDG Twitter account. I'll have to clear this new option with the other organizers of the when and the how implementation. Cheers!"
"I love the idea. Donna and Sunni - would it be worth having a chat offline about this? We have a couple of options that we can immediately explore to do this! Sunni - if you DM us (e.g. message me on Meetup) and share your email address, we could start a thread to chat more?"

"Thanks guys, it was great seeing you. Would love to see something on the infrastructure side. Please include latest technologies Google is working on, in SDN and infrastructure domains, whatever the speakers can shed light on. 

Would really appreciate if you can make this more of a conversational event, as compared to a classroom event."
I'm accessing the recorded live stream through the Periscope app by following The Practical Dev group. You can also click on the group's Twitter post about the event.
"Hello Rohit, as mentioned yesterday we will not have any insight into the secret sauce than what was published in white papers. 

We will try to find some engineers and possibly schedule a session in our future meetup's. Mostly all our quite conversational, will like to discuss what made you feel talks as classroom events. Thanks again"
We can explore this sure!! Can you identify specific topics and/or speakers you are interested in? We can try to connect accordingly.

Sorry. I can't make it today's event. I will go to the next event. Someone can take my spot.
Sorry. Last minute thing. Changed my RSVP.
"Hello! I cannot make it either - now have a conflict, updated my RSVP to no. Have a great meet up, see you next time."
"Gutted, but i m at home sick - changed my attendance to no"
@RalphYozzo could you free up her space so that some of us on waitlist can attend? Thank you @Aleksandra !

"Hello!
I am unsure of how the waitlist works. Would I receive an email if I am able to attend?"
"Hi Nitya, This will be my first google IO event, what should i bring to the event to confirm my reservation?"
"Nitya, mind cross checkin if my name was confirmed for code labs and the session. I think I have probably seen a note about it but can't seem to find the email. Thanks"
"Hello Atin, if you are confirmed for session, you are for code labs as well. You are confirmed for today's events."
I changed my status for today. I won't be able to make it.
"Unfortunately, I'll not be able to attend the meetup today. Changed by rsvp to No"
"Hello Nitya,
When do we get the confirmation for this event. I'd like to attend the codelabs, but still showing up under waitlist.

Thanks.!"
"Hello Saranraj, thanks for your interest in our event. Unfortunately, we will not be able to confirm anyone for this event due to space constraints. We extremely sorry for this inconvenience and hope to see you for our future events."

Hi Adam -- apologies just seeing this now. Check your meetup messages
If I won't get a discount. Can I pay at the door?
"I have a broken arm, was in accident. May I get a promo code since I had to pay the huge hospital bill and don't have $10 extra. I'd appreciate if that would be emailed to sergeitemplar@gmail.com please let me know. I believe I did register a while ago"
"Hi all - since GA is ticketing this for us, I don't have as much control over checking who is registered or not. I will try to get the list by Friday so I can verify at the time.


Re: promo code. We do have one that we are sending out to a limited number of folks based on need. However, once we hit our target participation number, we will try to provide the code to you for registration on a first-come-first-served basis till venue capacity is met. 

(Note: this means that by the time we share that code, its possible there may be only a limited number of open seats left so no guarantees at that time..)"
Are we getting a promo code for the event? I've also filled the form for 17th

Thank you,

Added you to my list. Hope to reach out early next week once I get those codes :-)
I'll be away on trip. I am giving up my seat!
"Great people, great food, free stuff and learning along the way! However, the place was small and seats were not all focused toward the screen and the screen was pretty small in itself. The speakers were cool but it felt a little too advanced and I was lost during several parts of their presentation. I guess they all assumed we would know what they are talking about. If the description had a little info on what we should have known prior to coming, that would have been nicer. Other than that, fantastic event given that it's at no cost to you."
Wonderful event as always! Learned a lot 😀
"Thank you for inviting me, had a great time! Here are Sentinel's slides with links to all its HW and SW components. https://goo.gl/CvK7ZQ"
DevFest 2017 was amazing. Special thanks to the Organizers and Panelist. I look forward to the next one.
I would like to say thank you to all speakers who took the time out to share their amazing passions/projects/work and to the organizers for hosting this fantastic event. I learned a lot and look forward to participating more in the future.
So fun! I learned a lot
"Thanks to the organizers, attendees, and other speakers for a great DevFest! Was great talking to many of you, and I hope to work with many of you as you develop some awesome actions. My slides are currently available at http://prisoner.com/ubi/, and I hope to have video from the event soon."
Great event!  Looking forward to seeing you all again!
Please note the updated information
What a great and informative session. Awesome job and Thanks to each Presenter and the GDG Bronx Organizers - zurcjoe.
a++++++
A nice time was had by all
Very good.
Big thanks to our hosts for a great event. I thought I posted a link to my slides. I don't see it. (Have I mentioned I hate the android meetup app? ) JIC here it is http://tinyurl.com/y7wadltv
It was pretty fun! Food was good and the speakers were fantastic!
"Great topics, I loved the presentations and learned a lot about each presenter. Thank you Eva, Hendrix and nelmer for this wonderful event!"
It was cool!
"This Meetup was great, I loved all of the presentations and the innovative projects they were working on. I was introduced to great tools I didn't know we're available."
Thank you ladies for hosting this great event- definitely looking forward to attending more in the future :)
"It was great to see & meet so many women entrepreneurs, developers hacking away... would love to attend more of these in the south bay!"
"Thank you, this is actually my first time."
"How will we know if the wait list is opening up ? Will we get an email in advance , or do we need to be on site ?"
"Hello Avi, thanks for your interest in our event. Unfortunately, we will not be able to confirm anyone for this event due to space constraints. We extremely sorry for this inconvenience and hope to see you for our future events."
"I have jury duty on Monday. The case was supposed to end this week, but it's been pushed back a few more days. I'll definitely still be going, though I may be a bit late."
"Thanks for updating, Hope to see you for our future events"
"Unfortunately I'm now sick and contagious =( Had to change my rsvp to a no. @Lakshma Devarapall­i, hope someone else can use my spot!"
"Thanks for updating, Get well soon. Hope to see you for our future events :)"
Please update your RSVP if you're not able to attend. I  on the waitlist and would like to participate!
"Sent an email, can someone please get back to me. Thanks!"
Hi Bev - apologies. I think I saw a meetup message from you but got sidetracked. Will respond on meetup thread now.
hello! I'm new to the group but I was just wondering how much we have to pay for the events after we have RSVPed?
Most of the events are free.
"Hey Sarah -- yes, most events are free and hosted at Google. 

Signature events (mostly our conferences like DevFestNYC, or workshops like AndroidCamp and more that we have planned for this year) will have prices clearly marked and are typically hosted at other venues."
I'll send you an email. I am taking a spot.
"I want to applaud the support from gdg. Today was an awesome event, well organized and well staffed. I took notes until my hands got tired (until the end) and I'm looking forward too giving my lightning talk soon."
"Hello Marco, thanks for coming forward to give lightning talk. Can you please fill this form, which will help us for housekeeping
http://bit.ly/iox-2017-gdgnyc-cfp"
Marco - just a heads up. If you would like to do a lightning talk just let us know the topic so we can add you to the list. It's filling up fast.
"Hi All -- We were able to finalize our speakers. There is great probability that we still missed to RSVP few members who attend our past events, please feel free to reach out to us and we will work on it. Sorry for our slow responses :-).

As usual, we request our members to update their RSVP their priority change to attend this event."
"The new system to disqualify people who RSVP, don't show up and can't even be bothered to change their status is pretty fair! To all the organizers, keep doing what you are doing! Your efforts and time are appreciated!"
"For the many years as a member of the various developer groups in NYC with Nitya.  She is always generous with her time, support, and knowledge."
"My two cents about the organizers, Nitya and Ralph have been wonderful organizers and that is evident from the exponential growth in the people requesting RSVP. The talks and speakers are quite impressive and this won't be feasible without dedicated effort from organizers. So hats off to the team.
~~~Suman"
Hi all -- I don't want to spam folks so just want to address a couple of things that I am reading here:
"Ralph and I rebooted this meetup in April 2016. Since then we have put in a lot of our time/effort into making sure we bring value to this community through a diversity of events, speakers and topics. The fact we grew 3500+ people in 1 year is (I think) a testament to our success at trying to meet those goals."
"That fast growth has also had its challenges. I know many of you are frustrated by not getting seats at events because the RSVP limits get met fast. 

We are working on a couple of solutions to solve this so please do help us out by giving us constructive ideas or coming up and speaking to us in person about issues or concerns you might have. 

If you have met or interacted with me, you will know that I am extremely open to conversations and ideas :-)"
"FInally:


We are a young, engaged and fast-growing meetup. We are trying to scale and bring on more people as we grow.  I am hugely committed to transparency - we try to be up front about how & why we do things. 

We want to have a way for everyone to get access to resources and benefit from limited perks. So we try to balance three criteria: early responses, regular attendance and personal context -- with 3500 people this is a true challenge but we are learning and improving on it.  


This is the start of year 2. We have big things planned. Thank you all for the support!"
"Since I have just landed to the USA, I am not the regular one to attend all the Events. But I will appreciate if you can allow me to kick start my journey with Google I/O Extended."
"Thanks again for all your time invested and help on updates/invites Nitya, look forward to the June I/O GDG NYC Chelsea Mkt see you then!"
when RSVP will be open?
"You can RSVP now and get on the waitlist. We will officially ""announce"" it and confirm RSVPs after our April meetup is done."
Would have been nice if you posted this link here instead of just email :-( http://bit.ly/io-extended-2017-googlenyc
"@Ron apologies for that - it was really short notice for us to send those names in so email was faster (posting to this only notifies those who have RSVP-ed while the email goes to all)


Also note that the two events are DIFFERENT. 

This one is the GDG NYC Extended event in Chelsea Market (happening after I/O)

The other was a Google NYC Extended event in the main building (happening during I/O)"
"OK, thx. Didn't realize it was 2 different events. Thx for the clarification."
"Ivan, I believe there's a google IO event in Jersey going on that you can attend"
"This is an event to learn about the latest announcements from I/O but also to foster more connections within our community around these technologies.



If you are attending I/O in person -- or you know someone who is -- please take a minute to fill in (or have them fill in) this form and come do a lightning talk (5 mins or 10 mins) for us. Talks can be about technology recaps, about attendee experiences or about behind-the-scenes interactions (exhibits, office hours, dev interactions) that don't get captured on the livestream!!

I learned a lot. Great speakers and topics!
Had lots of fun!
"Awesome! Thanks guys, hope to see you soon ;-)"
Excellent event! Where/when can we find the videos?
"I got 9 videos on my camera -- I'm not sure how many videos the other camera was able to pick up. I'll process and edit them this weekend, and then we should put them up on the WWC youtube. I'll post here when we do."
"I have a couple on my camera and a few on my phone. There were 1 or 2 talks we missed due to technical difficulties, so apologies to those folks!"
This was so great!!!
Thanks!
Carina - what's the format of the talks? I know ignite talks for example require 20 slides displayed for 20 seconds. Should we prepare slides for this event? Or spoken word only?
"The format of this is you have 5 minutes. You can do whatever you like with those 5 mins, slides or not, auto-advance or not. Most women make slides and advance them manually."
"great, thanks!"
"I would love to see what the other talks are going to be, beforehand!"
"Thanks for the nudge, Liz.  Done :-)"
"We're looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday for lightning talks!  If you're planning to talk, please sign up at http://bit.ly/TLgiaW so we can hold a timeslot for you (and give you a nice intro to the audience). :-)

P.S. Does anyone have a video camera you can bring? Recordings of our previous talks have been very appreciated.  We'd love to do it again."
Wish I could be there - but I'm in Austin!
my SLR can record HD video but I've never used it to record a long event (not sure if it would fit on a 32GB SD). I'll bring it and you can use it if you don't find a real video cam before then.
"Thanks, Michelle.  That sounds great. The talks are 5 minutes, so no worries about long event time.  If the SD fills, we'll improvise with a phone or something."

"What a Great and Informative Session today. I was only able to attend the first two presentations by Anna Nerezova and Amal Hussein - Both excellent presenters. 

I walked away with new thoughts, perspectives and some question marks on how to further exploit JavaScript and newer features contained in  today's modern browsers. 

GDG Team, Please keep this session coming. 

J."

"Last minute conflict, hope to make the next one."
"Big regrets -- won't make it to the city tonight.  See you on-line.

Thanks to Colt, Peter, Sean, Google, Udacity, and all the students who helped make this great. 

Behind on my game entry -- we'll see if I make it."
Sorry you could not make it Doug. Good news:  the contest deadline was extended to this Monday 4/15.
"Great finish to a great course. Thank you Colt, Peter, and Sean!!!"
"I just found this ""how to learn javascript properly"" learning roadmap, which looks really interesting and seems to be well-recommended. I'm going to take a look at it, if anyone else wants to join in! :-) http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/"
I've been looking at that too. Seems interesting.
I've been checking that out too; think I'm going to give it a serious shot. If anyone wants to do a study group following that path drop me a line!
"I'm interested in checking this out! Awesome, thanks for the find Alice!"
"I'm currently working on completing the ""web fundamentals"" series on codecademy, as per the recommendations. 

Trying to decide which of the two beginner books I should get. I'm leaning toward ""Professional Javascript for Web Developers""... just hoping that my 1 semester CS 101 counts as ""at least a bit of programming experience."""
"PS - ""JavaScript: The Definitive Guide"" is the recommended book for no programming experience. Both are linked there as part of the beginners' track."
May I please borrow a laptop? :)
I'm really sorry something urgent comes up.
"I can't make it tonight, see you next week!"
"Thanks to Alaina and all of the WWC organizers for a great event last night! It was really inspiring to see and meet so many confident and competent coders. 

As I mentioned last night, I invite everyone to join the Technical Women Speak Too G+ group if you're interested in speaking at tech confs: http://oreil.ly/TWS2

Also, I realized there was no date on the postcard about the women's meetup we're holding next week at Fluent--d'oh! It's Tues, May 28 at the Hilton Union Square, starting at 5:30. Everyone is welcome (guys too)! http://oreil.ly/FL13WCMU"
It was one of the best lightening talks to date.
"I'm sorry to cancel last minute as well, stuck at work until 8, hopefully someone can take my spot.  I'm working on a documentary about women tech founders so if this applies to you please reach out! Thanks again for throwing this event."
"Nora, I am a woman founder of an ed tech start up.  LMK if I can help."
Can't get away just yet...sorry to miss it.
Stuck @ work. So looking forward for this.
Got some last minute work :( Really was looking forward towards it .
"Folks, can't make it tonight.  But will certainly make it next time.  BTW, looking for an engineer/coder interested in the ed tech space.  Huge traction, huge potential.  Check out openstudy.com and get a sense of the action. After the all male team that built it, would LOVE to have a woman engineer. Lift/Scala/MongoDb anyone?"
"Hi gals, I can't make it tonight, but wanted to give a shout-out.  I'm looking for great female engineers for a game-changing health care startup.  You can check us out on angellist:  https://angel.co/the-cognitive-healthcare-company.  See you at the next meetup!"
"Sorry, not feeling well.  Hopefully next time."
"Psyched to join the meetup tonight. I'm VP of Engineering at BandPage, and always looking to meet fellow female coders. Also, and not entirely coincidentally, I'm hiring! Looking forward to meeting some interesting folks and hearing some cool talks!  :-)"
"I have to work late tonight and won't make it. To whoever takes my spot, enjoy!"
"Sorry, can't make it tonight - hopefully someone else can take my spot."
"I'm going to have to miss this one.  Sorry.  Also, I signed up to speak so can you take my name off the list.  Thanks - see you next time."
"Security needs your first and last name so if it is not listed on Meetup Please email it to me alainapercival @ gmail.com 

If you aren't going to be able to attend please update your RSVP we have quite a few people on the waiting list. 

Finally, if you really wanted to give a talk and didn't get to signup in time please send me an email with your topic."
Fingers crossed!
unfortunately I can't make it this time :(
"I would love to attend this event, but I'm on the waitlist! We are looking for an awesome Ruby on Rails developer to join our team at www.DohJe.com, making it easy to thank great caregivers."
Just joined this. Can't wait to attend my first meetup.

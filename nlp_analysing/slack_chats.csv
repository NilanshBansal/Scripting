1,That bullet proof coffee sounds insane.
2,That guy has huge eyes.
3,@54a47e0cdb8155e6700e486e It is. but it works. some people just can't handle the taste :P
4,They guy that came up with the idea is kind of a joke though...
5,that sounds like torture actually :)
6,the*
7,I might try it out for fun-just one bullet proof coffee that is.
8,@54a44bbbdb8155e6700e47de I agree. he's pretty extreme lol
9,he's like the Bear Grylls of diets
10,haha
11,"I have zero intention of doing the whole diet bit of it, I just want the nommy creamy fatty coffee"
12,and the energy
13,I can't help but laugh at my own joke/reference lol
14,"Anyone near LA/Santa Monica, CA want to host me and my wife for a week or two? :D"
15,haha
16,I would if I didn’t have my son and his family camping in my den
17,tho we aren’t that close to santa monica
18,"How close is ""not that close""? lol"
19,"hmm, 2 hour drive, but thats because the freeways are a nightmare :)"
20,Here's one of the things I love about Meteor and everything that surrounds it's structure...the way that things associated to Meteor directly reference back to the branding idea of an actual physical meteor object.
21,Atmosphere as the package manager
22,Meteorites as the package installer
23,The oortcloud...etc
24,"HAH I’m using skitch for bills my kids owe me, pink pointers everywhere!"
25,I’m the most annoying mom
26,@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a Meteorites is not a thing anymore :P
27,lame
28,it is now the term used to describe someone who is a meteor developer
29,(and it was replaced by atmosphere)
30,!lame anymore
31,that sounds cooler than a Djangonaut
32,or better yet...a Pythonista
33,always hated that
34,lol
35,"when making the robot eyes blink I get  lasers but there is some problem.
There are 2 eyes when they are white and 1 eye - red"
36,@54711060db8155e6700d72c1 That is a bug/flaw in the Dash course. it's not your fault haha
37,think about the way you created two eyes in the first place and do the same thing on the  `@keyframes blink` sections
38,bummer I want them both to turn red
39,ok Ill try that

41,Hello Everyone I am new here
42,"So just finished up the jQuery Challenges and Im getting the hang of it, is there any benefit to continue learning this with Code School, or should I stay on track with the FCC challenges."
43,welcome to FreeCodeCamp @54a48917db8155e6700e4887
44,I’m partial to FCC challenges @54987ee2db8155e6700e2207 :)

86,"Thank you, and Happy New Year!"
87,I did for sure. Helped my brother program a random name generator for an incremental clicker game based on Too Many Cooks
88,And then decided I wanted get into Javascript/Canvas game programming but realized I was in way over my head real fast
89,So I'm going to commit to more FreeCodeCamp lessons before I tackle the new project :)
90,2015 Resolution: I am going to learn how to do CRUD operations on the DOM using JQuery. :)

103,@54a4a00ddb8155e6700e48d7 nice photo. Are you interested in Astronomy?
104,"Yes, same to you. :) Ticket queue at work is very slow right now, so I decided do some reading on, you know, stuff, and I stumbled on the FreeCodeCamp site tonight. "
105,"I am interested in Star Trek. Does that count? Astral bodies are cool, but my knowledge of astronomy is minimal."
106,Thanks @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c :)
107,@54a4a00ddb8155e6700e48d7 Which captain is your favorite?
108,"Oh boy, the debate of the ages. I'll have to go with Sisko, I think. What about you?"
109,picard
110,I've found Free Code Camp in reddit and I already know to code. I'm interested in socialize with other devs
111,There's no BAD captain. It's so hard to choose.
112,@54a0ace5db8155e6700e38bf Gitter is still relatively new and kinda of buggy so it needs to be refreshed manually pretty often
113,@54a4a0c4db8155e6700e48df Great! You came to the right place. Keep in mind that most people are new or intermediate devs
114,@54a4a0c4db8155e6700e48df do you do much Express.js development?
115,@54a4a00ddb8155e6700e48d7 Safe answer ;)
116,lol
117,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a Picard FTW.
118,I’m still waiting for Star Trek the Next Next Generation with Wesley Crusher at the helm
119,Didn't he abandon starfleet for the Traveler's powers? >.>
120,Aaaaaaaaaaanyway....

126,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c No problem. I work as a native mobile developer but I really don't have much experience in the javascript ecosystem.... Maybe this would be a good oportunity to learn and practice it.
127,Janeway was cool but she had that Pepperidge Farms voice.
128,you mean upper east coast?
129,Big fan of BSG both old and new. Is that what her accent was? :)
130,well I didn’t hear it but it is the pepperidge farms guys accent
131,sort of maine newhampshire

135,hahaha nice!
136,"no. 43 was changed before she took the helm to “no ONE has gone before"""
137,I watched a lot of Star Trek... Never got into Jonathan Archer. I think he quantum leaped into that seat.
138,"Enterprise is cool (despite the ret-con of Klingon foreheads), but Bakula does seem out of place."

201,"Howdy, I'm new here"
202,hi there @547b77bbdb8155e6700d996e welcome to our community
203,"Hey, thanks!"
204,Same here...stumbled upon it via reddit today. It's at the top of r/javascript
205,welcome aboard @54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806
206,"It's a career shift. I've been out of college for about 6 years now on a film production degree, and the only work I've ended up getting is really awful office stuff, so I've been studying front end development and graphic design for the past six months and really want to get serious about getting a job doing web development in 2015"
207,Do you know if this is only javascript? 
208,welcome @547b77bbdb8155e6700d996e
209,Thanks!
210,"we are JS focused, MEAN stack, at the moment"
211,So how many different non-profit projects are there right now?
212,"Oh, that's great, thank you. I know a good amount of ruby/rails, but am definitely looking to learn MEAN."
213,"quite a few, I’ll check for a count, but we are getting contacted daily"
214,"I coundt 14 that have been greenlit, I don’t have a count of how many are waiting"
215,"Oh sweet. That's what has been the hardest for me to find. I can blow through the tutorials, code academy and such, but getting actual hands on experience coding has been problematic.. I usually just feel like a leaf blown around by the wind because I really  don't know where to go or what to start doing after finishing the tutorials."
216,its exciting for sure 
217,"@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 I'm the same way. After I finish some tutorials, I'm like ""ok, now how do I actually make something?""...projects will be really fun!"
218,"Yeah I lack a certain amount of artsy creativity, I'm more of a here's what we need, make it happen kinda guy..So coming up with my own project is troublesome for me..."
219,"if anyone is interested ever, message me, I have links for project ideas for your portfolio"
220,"Hello World, and happy new year! Looking forward to starting this course!"
221,welcome @54a4bd62db8155e6700e4935!
222,ty @54a4b680db8155e6700e491e :D
223,Hello there @54a4bd62db8155e6700e4935 welcome to our community
224,@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 the way I got into learning JavaScript was by sort of lying to someone about my JS knowledge when I was building their website by telling them I could build them this real-time calculator thing
225,and then you went and learned how to do it
226,"yeah, thats how we all get going :)"
227,exactly! and it turned out really nice
228,"That's how I got started, too"
229,"I had the help of an awesome dev I found on Reddit, too"
230,"it puts a good fire under your butt, gives you the inspiration to actually learn"
231,"@54a4bd62db8155e6700e4935 totally, and I was like ""you're paying me waaaay too much money for me to screw this up"" :)"
232,"Haha yeah, I had a ton of stress and nightmares about messing it up, but I came out with enough knowledge to create a basic business site"
233,"Yeah, I have a very small non-profit that I just took over the website for, that is what partially drove me into it, also I see web dev as the primary method of consumption in the future. Why build programs that install on somebody's computer when I can run things in the browser, and have the same hardware access, but far more control over the use/updating of my product."
234,@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 I agree
235,"I'm in systems administration right now, and even we are being forced to code."
236,Code is the future
237,and I for one welcome our new robot overlords
238,lol
239,JS is the future
240,"I plan to build our new robot overlords btw, so put in your requests now"
241,for how you would like skynet to be
242,"@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 with the diversity of devices we're using to access data these days, companies aren't going to want to code separate apps for Windows/OSX/iOS/Android/Kindle/Toasters when they could just develop an awesome responsive website or app and call it a day"
243,yes
244,My only skynet request is to have it make the perfect pizza
245,Everything short of nukes and guns...I don't really want to have to live a dystopian existence in the future. I'm not that much of a Hunger Games fan.
246,thats a given :)
247,"@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 I mean, at least it's exciting :)"
248,I like showers and warm meals. I've lived on a diet of MRE's before...it's not really all it's cracked up to be in the movies.
249,@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 well coding will ensure you a healthy diet of Taco Bell and Mountain Dew for sure :)
250,Some of the links are behind a pay wall. Is that normal?
251,like http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/46
252,Pay wall? 
253,@531189665e986b0712efc2b3 I'm not getting any kind of paywall message
254,I am
255,I can't see the video. Hmm.
256,You may need to sign up for a CodeSchool account
257,enroll now to play :(
258,and I thought this whole thing was free
259,^ yep
260,Hello World!
261,Hello!
262,Hi!
263,"Ahhh, I think CodeSchool might have had that video be free for a while, they have intros to stuff be free and then the more advanced videos cost money. It's a great service though, I just bought the full year for about $180 on Black Friday"
264,Yeah it looks like that part IS behind a paywall
265,BUT
266,You should be able to learn that subject elsewhere by googling it
267,it might take more effort and more time though :(
268,"sorry, what subject is behidn a paywall?"
269,ExpressJS
270,Just one little bit of the whole thing
271,"ALso If you are that far along, you could pay the $30 bucks as an investment on your future."
272,"Ah. I believe there’s an option for a “hall pass"""
273,I'll just use teamtreehouse. Thanks y'all
274,does that discount the price?
275,https://www.codeschool.com/hall_passes/f13d3c3e1f66/claim_shared'
276,Hall Pass link
277,2 free days.
278,"however, if you’re that far along, I might also recommend looking into a book titled “Mean Web Development” by the original author of the popularized MEAN stack and who maintains the MEANJS stack. The e-edition is cheaper than a month of code school, and obviously the book covers a lot more"
279,"Thanks @5471b82adb8155e6700d7478, I'll look into it."
280,"There's also this for a $9 first month...it's an affiliate link, not from me, I found it on some random site: https://www.codeschool.com/enrollments/cVZvdEsyVUw2TE1nWW9VMWI1aFBocVZwUVoxR25QVmhxZ0s4dExob2k1VT0tLWpoZnd1cGczSlpKcllFWXQveUdsQ3c9PQ==?utmr=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fbit.ly%252FNineDollarTrial%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNGEmnH3yitRjxQjhpfYam0HRkiqWg"
281,"Alternatively, and a completely viable option, is to visit [this forum post](http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/hello-bookmarks/73) and integrate some of the links into your own bookmarks. Mongoose, Express, and Angular have excellent free tutorials on their respective websites. Nodeschool.io is a great place to go to learn about node more in depth."
282,"The CodeSchool tutorial on Angular is pretty good and is 100% free, Google is footing the bill on that one"
283,"Well, see you all later, have a great new year!"

287,"Cotter doesn't look like an eccentric millionaire, he looks like several of the drunk dudes that used to run around my college dorm wing."
288,Hey guys guess what?
289,what what
290,Comcast doubled our internet speed for free! 
291,What?!
292,wow
293,nice
294,How'd you make that happen?
295,"Yeah, we were paying for 25 Mbps and they doubled everyone in the neighborhoods internet. So now we are getting around 50 Mbps."
296,Sweet! Wish my comcast deal was as generous.
297,The only problem is everyone is using the internet so it keeps going up and down.
298,So you really have a 50Mbps pipe that you are forced to share with the whole neighborhood...that's sad...but exciting because now you have more pipe to share!!!!!
299,"No I get 50 Mbps, we almost never have internet shortages. It is probably because it is new years and everyone is streaming videos."
300,Ah cool.
301,"###Raise your hand if you aren't doing anything for new years

306,yes it does

344,yeah it really is.

354,That would work as well. 
355,"alright everyone, off the computer till next year. Have a super evening! "

I found the FreeCodeCamp on reddit, it seems like a really good place to brush up on my programming and make some friends."
467,@54a5222adb8155e6700e4a27 great to have you aboard. What is your programming background?

469,"that’s really cool, and it sounds like you are in a great spot already"
470,"As you work your way through the challenges make sure you check into the forums and some of our other specific use rooms for help and pair programming. And, of course, you can always shout out in here for help or for general conversation when you need to give your eyes a break from the matrix"

572,@iyeager2004 It depends on your free time. Or available time.

574,so 30 minutes to 12 hours a day :)

578,OK time for the [Winter Classic](http://www.nbcsports.com/hockey/nhl/nationals-park-ready-2015-winter-classic)!
579,I'm experiencing an issue with FreeCodeCamp Github signup. Where do I report this ?. I already tried @546fd55adb8155e6700d6eac
580,You should fill in real information about yourself.
581,Your own e-mail.
582,"Okay so this is the issue; I tried to logging in with Github. Instead of taking me to the ""authorize app"" page, I got logged into an account created randomly. The user icon, the name and location shown on the profile page is not mine. When I delete this account and try again, I get logged in with another set of random user details."
583,Good morning and Happy New Year CodeCampers
584,"@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 FCC is geared towards busy people, you can take it in small manageable chunks, an hour at a time is perfectly fine, any goal you set for yourself beyond that is gravy!"
585,Weird you could try to change all the user information and make it your own account.
586,"@54a588c9db8155e6700e4b6f thank you for the headsup, this is a known issue, we are tracking it. Is it possible for you to log in with twitter or facebook instead?"
587,Oh that's the issue dumb me.
588,"Yeah I could do that, in fact I created an account using Twitter login. But I'm trying to report this issue to the devs do that they could fix this."
589,I’m the person to report to :)
590,Okay cool.
591,"thank you, we do apologize for the inconvenience"
592,Try clear the browser cache? @54a588c9db8155e6700e4b6f
593,"No worries, just wanted to help."
594,I appreciate it :)
595,Hi guys please tell me im quite noob too all this programming stuff is this a good way too learn from scratch?? :)
596,this is an excellent way to learn from scratch @54a58ee1db8155e6700e4b7e
597,thanks odrisck :D
598,"every member of the FCC team is dedicated to helping in anyway we can, so please come ask for help, we’ll pair up with you as well to walk you through things you are finding difficult"
599,thats good too know :clap: 
600,"hi ppl, happy new year, just starting out so a bit green, any ideas why this code line wnt work? background: #000 url(<a href=""http://imgur.com/imIT4""><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/imIT4.jpg"" title=""source: imgur.com"" /></a>"");"
601,"Wow, that's great!
"
602,The a and the img tag isnt needed
603,yes because you need to specify those things seperate. background-image: url
604,so make your color on one line
605,and do a second line for the img
606,oh yes and the a isn’t needed
607,heh
608,didn’t even get that far
609,haha
610,here is one I have up right now for a project I’m working on
611,"body {
	background:white;
  background-image: url('background.png');
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;"
612,Before i joined FCC i already did all the things on Dash. So I was like shit I already did all this.
613,oh nice
614,I enjoyed dash more than what we had up there before
615,"Oh, why?
"
616,"actual projects, so while you learn you are actually producing something tangible"
617,and the robot was fun :)
618,"Yep, it was."
619,The rich dancing guy.
620,I like that it gets people thinking about the flexibility of css 
621,I’m all for as few images as possible on my pages
622,"Joined today at FCC! :)
"
623,welcome to our community :)
624,Thanks!
625,"Already love it, this chat thing is awesome"
626,"yeah, its pretty awesome :)"
627,"Going to get a drink, brb."
628,ok
629,@54a56eb0db8155e6700e4af8 Greetings and welcome to FCC!
630,Thanks! :smile: 
631,"heh had to go check the bathroom skylight, my daughter thought it was leaking"
632,"also I’m happy to report, I am in love with bulletproof coffee"
633,"bulletproof coffee?
"
634,Can't really get dash to accept my work.. http://i.imgur.com/RyPaPoY.png
635,"yeah, coffee with coconut oil and butter then put in the blender"
636,ah
637,I don't see anything wrong.
638,let me check my Dash.
639,thanks @54a56eb0db8155e6700e4af8
640,what about your border radisu on the torso
641,border-radius:
642,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 From what little I've seen here in the last 20 seconds, I take it you're the person to talk with about FCC site issues?"
643,yes thats me
644,border-radius: 20px 20px 100px 100px; might need to be this
645,hello world!
646,@54a56eb0db8155e6700e4af8 okay thanks
647,welcome aboard @54a59508db8155e6700e4b95
648,"I just set up an account and was logged in as someone else. A Google search revealed this is known, but do I need to worry about others being logged in as myself?"
649,your foot is also missing some things
650,Could also be another thing that I added in later lessons @5495b986db8155e6700e17e4
651,"no your account information is safe, its an authentication issue between github and FCC, are you able to log in using twitter or facebook?"
652,What? @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 I don't see any difference between my Dash?
653,"I’m looking at my completed robot, I just noticed which checkpoint and the issue is likely with the torso :)"
654,"I was able to log in fine with my Google account, and I revoked access for FCC through GitHub. I just wasn't sure if I should be concerned about my own information."
655,"awesome, thank you @54a59514db8155e6700e4b99, your information is safe"
656,Thanks for the reassurance. :)
657,@5495b986db8155e6700e17e4 is it fixed?
658,"I’m glad to help :), the reason we use the log in process we do is so we don’t directly have your information, its some issue with github authentication, I can imagine its disturbing to see someone elses name there :)"
659,I use twitter to login so I hadn’t seen it
660,"I we wrote my code, and somehow it fixed it.."
661,rewrote*
662,"awesome, sometimes that happens @5495b986db8155e6700e17e4"
663,"@5495b986db8155e6700e17e4 Sometimes that fixes my code too, i think it's a bug"
664,"It was a bit disturbing, especially since it was a gentleman that lives in my town. He didn't seem particularly active on the site, so there was nothing to mess with. :D"
665,lol
666,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 You said you like to keep images to a minimum, does using styling to create psuedo-images (like the robot excercise) cut down on load times? For example, if you created the robot as an image and just added the animation for the eyes over it, would that have a noticable load time effect?"
667,I don't think It would. But let the master answer.
668,"Also, another quick question about web design to anyone. I've never considered the DOM as a tree until going through the Code School tutorials. When the 'pros' are designing and coding web pages is it a typical excercise to write out the DOM as a tree?"
669,They probably already got it in their head.
670,My robot antenna got messed up but I finished the lesson? http://i.imgur.com/6xETy9z.png
671,Oh lol
672,but gj!
673,Thanks aha
674,"I’m hardly the Master. What I have is a respect for using code to create visuals. images will always have a place, but I like that you can be so flexible with just code, it makes me have a happy :)"
675,"I think you can load your page down with way to much code as easily as you can with images, but at its core, the computer sees it all as code"
676,"for example, I rather style text in css than the way we use to do it, create an image file with text in an image program then load it into a table in a web page, thats just pure bloat"
677,"Makes sense. Plus, easier to change when the customer decides to change from Franks Deli to Frank's Deli. "
678,"yes. Also, I try to keep this in mind, as I learn. I need to always know WHY I’m choosing to do something a certain way. If I decide I need to do this in JS, I need to know why, is it better in some way or am I being lazy :)"
679,"Hmm, great mindset"
680,"just an example, so sometimes I’ll choose to do something in css and sometimes I’ll add an image or whatever, but, I have to be able to articulate to myself, why, and be satisfied that its the best choice"
681,The duck on the desk.
682,When writing code I've always explained it to the rubber duck on my desk. Talking out code makes me find bugs before I write it.
683,oh yeah I find that simply the act of articulating what issue I’m having will produce an answer
684,thats why I really love that we have this community available
685,not everyone is ok with talking to a rubber duck :P
686,Good ol' rubber duck debugging.
687,lmao
688,Going to challenge 10 :)
689,right on
690,Hello!

698,"In the 'Working with the DOM' tutorials it teaches addClass and removeClass, and than shows remove all .highlight classes before adding it. You can cut all that down to one line of code using the toggleClass. Funny that they left that out."
699,"The great thing is though, that as I'm doing the examples I have my own web-page open on another laptop and I'm refactoring it to use jQuery everywhere instead of all my DOM Javascript. So much cleaner."

722,I use wordpress for my blog

728,@547664a9db8155e6700d8846 I would suggest a self-hosted WordPress blog.
729,WordPress it is. Now to find a decent host!

745,Hello World! Employi @ Arduino in Sweden signing in. Want to learn how to code. Only have a little experience with programming in C.
746,"ok so here is the advice I give on that issue, because it worked for me, I moved my code over to codepen, put it in the proper lil boxes, and it all works"
747,"thats how I realized my code worked, so if refreshing the page doesn’t fix the issue, try porting it over to codepen "
748,Dang robot!
749,"so you know if you have your code right, other than that I’ll post the link to my codepen robot so you can check your cocde, it looks right to me, but I could be missing something"
750,http://codepen.io/kodriscoll/pen/RNRpXZ
751,I tried it in code pen but it didnt work there either.  thank you @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97. Did you get it to work on dash as well?
752,nope it never worked on dash
753,"go compare your code to mine, see if you can find the problem"
754,"my laser eyes kept flashing into one, so I’d have two red and one big cyclops white eye"
755,it was posted here yesterday that the problem could be fixed by:
756,paul davidson
757,The Dash CSS Robot challenge was a lot of fun! Noticed that I had to include the background-size again (75px 150px) in the animation keyframes selector as well...else would get a single red blinking light instead of matching against the 2 white lights. Pretty nifty CSS animation features!
758,"i don't know if this will help, I haven't tried it, but maybe it will of some assistance"
759,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 Im wondering why no one else is complaining about.  The only thing I see different is u use a different jquery link
760,lots of folks have had problems with the robot :)
761,I notice that each counselor has a different solution response too LOL
762,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 is there  a way we can compare our code to yours, or did you email it or something?"
763,"no one is responding on the facebook Q&A.  Frustrating, I hate to move onto another step without getting this to work.  I changed the jquery link and that didn't work.  I'll keep looking."

I'm a recent mechanical engineering grad but I've been increasingly working towards a career in web development. I completed a web dev bootcamp this past Summer and have been building some skills on my own in my free time since then but it's a challenge. Looking forward to working with some people, great idea!

792,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 @54a0ace5db8155e6700e38bf I got it to work it was a issue with the double quotes vs single quotes (their slides show the quotes both ways more than once!
793,however it still only works in codepen
794,"I’m so glad you figured it out, those quotes will get you everytime :)"

800,Hey for everyone that is on or has done the Stanford course. What speed do you watch the videos. I personally watch them at 1.5x the speed because they get slightly boring.
801,"#6 ""Create a small style in the main stylesheet, and give it an opacity of 0"""
802,can you post your code
803,"Er, the whole thing, or the bit that changes opacity"
804,@5473c1b7db8155e6700d7cf1  I watch them at about 2.5 or 3x
805,the bit they are asking for
806,You can watch them at 3x?
807,just for the checkpoint
808,"small {
  color: rgba(255,255,255,0);
}"
809,I only get the option to 2x
810,I do a lot of online video learning. So I bought a program called enounce. It allows up to 4x on flash videos
811,the small business websites checkpoint 6 is not that
812,http://www.enounce.com/myspeed
813,OK
814,@5473c1b7db8155e6700d7cf1 I speed them up.
815,"Well, its telling me to do that, and it says its checkpoint #6"
816,for esha’s restaurant?
817,Yes.
818,ok looking
819,"I had to work up to where I am at. I started at 1.5, when to 2, then 2.5, then 3...Also depends on the speaker...some speakers are especially trying, so I push them to 3.5 or 4..."
820,But it's nice watching 40 hours of video in 10 - 20 hours time. Gives me 20 hours I otherwise wouldn't have.
821,"Yeah, I bet that is very nice"
822,http://i.imgur.com/59e6qjn.png
823,period before the small class?
824,"unless you set something to the class of small, you don’t need a period because its referring to where you used <small>"

837,didnt use one :)
838,"I brewed my coffee in a french press, poured enough for two mugs into the blender with about a tbs of butter and a tbs of coconut oil and blended well till all frothy"
839,Well that's kind of a recipe :) I thought it was more involved. So it's butter and coconut oil?
840,"yes, grass fed butter and virgin coconut oil"
841,the good stuff
842,"we use sugar, good actual cane sugar"
843,none of that fakey crap
844,heh well I don't have that stuff so I'll use peanut butter and olive oil just to try it out...
845,I try to only eat things that can be produced naturally :)
846,"I'm joking I'll look into the good stuff. 
"
847,"if I need a processing plant for it, I am pretty careful about whether I consume it"

853,"welcome to FCC @54a59d6edb8155e6700e4bba, We take you from front end, some html/css, through JS and jQuery and into the backend with node.js and Mongodb"

860,"@54711060db8155e6700d72c1 a note on dynamics URIs. If an https resource is available, it should always be used"
861,"heh, dash has removed my buttons, I’m glad I moved it over to codepen :)"
862,"sorry, protocol relative.."
863,"oh there they are, I was at the wrong point in the lesson LOL"
864,I already have my jquery after my fonts
865,OOO but I did figure out why it wasn’t working. my jquery link only had one / rather than two I had <script src=“/assets/jquery.js”></script>  it needed to be <script src=“//assets/jquery.js”></script>  In codepen I have a different link to jQ
866,I'm guessing one of their slides was wrong...
867,I think I probably had one / before as well
868,"likely, but now we’ve caught it, and when it happens to the next person we can answer better :)"
869,try.jQuery.com taught me so much. I have pages and pages of notes that will surely be handy one day.
870,yeah onto challenge 20
871,gtg see you guys later

885,Through a blog post linked via reddit.com/r/webdev .  Sounds like a neat program/community!
886,we are a fantastic community :)

899,I am doing step 3. Now I'm on the part where I'm building my own portfolio after help building a website for Anna. I'm not sure what I should put on my own website. I have not changed the photo yet. https://dash.generalassemb.ly/t518961/build-your-own-personal-website

905,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 any thoughts on my situation?
906,my sole purpose coming here today was to figure this out haha
907,"`ahhh... the 'ol, ""Why are we using javascript"" discussion going on again` Where is this discussion?"
908,"honestly I don’t have much experience with two monitors, the bf thinks I need to use the big monitor with my laptop, and I can see the benefit of two, but really when I was working on that ginormous monitor I didn’t feel like I needed anymore space"
909,ya. i used two when i was working but one was just a web browser
910,"and now that I have a hotkey for a fullscreen terminal, idk if i'd need that"
911,"I think if he set me up with two I would likely prefer it, but I just don’t really see it right now"

917,Hi there @54a5d7cbdb8155e6700e4ca6
918,but I can get a kickass linux system going for $300
919,how are they hideous? I haven't seen one in person. The specs seem pretty good.
920,I suggest you do!
921,I was thinking of maybe doing this: ![stand](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BdDRxvRDL._SY355_.jpg)
922,isn’t she pretty
923,That's cool.
924,I don't know how you guys work with only one screen though xD
925,"finally cleared the ticket queue at work, time to start back to the FCC challenges. :)"
926,"ya, and then just connect the thunderbolt to my iMac and use my mbp"

928,"a lot of people prefer two, its just not something I’ve found a need for, now if I was a designer? yeah that I can see, or a games dev? even then I can see it"
929,I like the idea of one really wide monitor.
930,good point @546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8
931,it's easier to swipe back and forth on the trackpad then move the mouse cursor all the way to a second monitor
932,^
933,3 finger swipe for workspaces is my jam
934,"which, being on a 13"" monitor, i usually have 5 or 6 desktops open at a time"

940,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 they re-order automatically, but you can turn that feature off"
941,WindowsKey+ArrowKeys is super convenient.
942,oooooooh i hate the auto-reordering
943,lol
944,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 the re-ordering is probably what confused you
945,"once i turned that off, it was 100 times better"
946,"oh thanks, I’ll do that and see if its better :)"
947,and then you can assign apps to certain desktops and they are always there
948,nice
949,"yep thats precisely what confused me, if its all organized I can do it, but if I have to hunt I figure it may as well all be in a big pile in front of me"
950,"ok, I think this talk is helping me decide that i can deal with one monitor and just put my laptop to the side when i'm using the big screen"
951,easier to hunt it down
952,"@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 I didn't know that, that makes things so much easier! Thank you :)"
953,"`ok, I think this talk is helping me decide that i can deal with one monitor and just put my laptop to the side when i'm using the big screen` YES"

991,hey @547375d0db8155e6700d7b1d
992,Hi. I manage a couple of IT projects and do some php and javascript.  This seems like a great approach to learning and doing some good in the world so I thought I would check it out.
993,hello @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97
994,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c thanks! You've created an awesome resource here!
995,"I am taking challenge #5 Build a Business Website. My code challenge to put in a background image in my div element does not work. I've checked a previous code and I thought I wrote it correctly. Kindly review my code:

1010,hello world
1011,greetings and welcome to our community @54a5f7eddb8155e6700e4d15
1012,Has anyone get a job after finishing these challenges?
1013,@54a5f7eddb8155e6700e4d15 Greetings from San Francisco!
1014,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 The challenges are just the first part. The real work is building projects for nonprofits
1015,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/12/free-code-camps-new-challenges-short.html
1016,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c Thank you very much :D
1017,hey thanks! I've been coding on my own and have worked through quite a few tutorials ect. a friend turned me on to free code camp
1018,"@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 Also, we just started like 80 days ago, so the first people to start this are just now starting on the nonprofit projects"
1019,looking forward to trying it out. im especially happy to see a community of people i can talk to/ask questions!
1020,@54a5f7eddb8155e6700e4d15 Great! Well we’re looking forward to coding along side you (and hopefully pair programming as well) :computer:
1021,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c Great! I'm looking forward to reach to the end.
1022,"That's what brought me here. I have seen that I needed to have ""project"" to be able to get hired, and this place allows me to do that, and help non-profits...it's like a karma win win.."
1023,"I also am doing a Front-End Web Developer track at TeamTreehouse, this is going straight into jQuery. Why is it like that? Treehouse tells me to learn the foundation of Javascript."
1024,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c I don't know if this is the right forum for this kinda chat but I'd be really interested to hear more about what your thoughts / plans are for scaling. I can image there will be a lot of interest and it might change the dynamics of eg this chat but also group projects if MAUs increase exponentially. I like the focus on real projects - an oft repeated criticism of stuff like codecademy (which I love) is that it's too theoretical and covers syntax but not nitty gritty practicalities.
1025,"@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c and the rest of the gang at FCC, not sure if you hear this enough, but thanks for putting this together. I've always been able to find the free tutorials and tracks, but it's the concrete work examples that leave me struggling to put the pieces together or make an impact in the workplace. You guys have bridged that gap between learning on your own, and successfully utilizing free resources towards putting yourself on a tech-career path."
1026,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 Other parts of the challenges go through more js. Such as the codecademy js and coderbyte challenges.
1027,"I am in the challenge 5 building a small business website. Can I get a hint at what I need code i need to write for this challenge: ""Wrap the rest of each menu description inside small tags""."
1028,<small></small>
1029,It's a formatting tag.
1030,@54a5e1c7db8155e6700e4ccb I think jQ is actually a relatively easy intro to understanding JS and what its doing
1031,"So, it'll look something like this <small> menu description here </small>"
1032,thank you @54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 I feel the same way about FCC  :)
1033,@54873b94db8155e6700dd723  Thank you for your response
1034,I kind of felt like JQ was learning cheater JS. So many handy functions that obfuscate that pesky parts of navigating the DOM in JS.
1035,I mean @54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 :)
1036,heh the chat gets away from me at times
1037,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 haha xD, it's okay! Thank you for the response also. I'm beginning to like this community."
1038,"I’m so glad, I really feel that the community we have going here is the most valuable resource for learning "
1039,"@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3  here is what I coded. Didn't work: 
<small>
<div class=""first"">
<p>Welsh onion soko $14 <br /> Mustard sierra leone bologi kale chard beet greens black-eyed pea sorrel amaranth garlic tigernut spring onion summer purslane asparagus lentil. </p>
</div>
</small>"
1040,"@549f7898db8155e6700e3586 Just wrap the text in the <small> tags. <small> is a formatting shortcut for text, like using <h1>."
1041,I am I replacing <p> with <small>
1042,nope. Ok. I'll keep at it. even googled to fry to find answer. I'll read my CSS book
1043,Don't replace. Just put it inside. The <p> puts the text into a paragraph the <small> makes the text look small. 
1044,put it inside the div
1045,"<div class=""first"">

<p><small>Welsh onion soko $14 <br /> Mustard sierra leone bologi kale chard beet greens black-eyed pea sorrel amaranth garlic tigernut spring onion summer purslane asparagus lentil. </small></p>
</div>"
1046,not outside it
1047,yes like that ^
1048,"<div class=""first”> this is for styling in your css, <small> is html text styling so should be right around the text you wish to make smaller"
1049,OMG.. thanks! what does the <small></small> element function as? 
1050,"<small> is a css tag. Later you'll learn that you can make the text wrapped in <small> tags be whatever you want, In fact, you can change it based on the browser size, so you can have small be one thing on a computer screen and something completely different on a phone's screen."
1051,Cool @54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 . Thanks a lot for taking time to explain it. Thanks 2 @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 you rock 2.
1052,https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small here is an explanation of <small>
1053,you bet
1054,thumbs up!
1055,"Please explain:  ""Comment out"" the paragraph style in your CSS "
1056,to comment something out you put // or /* in front of it
1057,use the style they have for their notes already present
1058,it means the browser will not read it
1059,I believe its going to be //
1060,"Example: 
/* first menu*/
<p><small>Welsh onion soko $14 <br /> Mustard sierra leone bologi kale chard beet greens black-eyed pea sorrel amaranth garlic tigernut spring onion summer purslane asparagus lentil.</small></p>"
1061,you want two //
1062,/* blah blah*/
1063,// blah blah//
1064,// then here is the code
1065,"in your css, the above isn’t css its html"
1066,"Do I comment before <p> or before <div class="""">"
1067,"you don’t comment there, you comment out the p styling in your css between the <style> </style> "
1068,does break need to be self close 
1069,you have presumably written some css for paragraphs in your css which lives between the style tags in your html document if you aren’t using a style sheet
1070,<br/>
1071,"I’ve never done, but its become preferable to do <br />"
1072,<br /> worked for me
1073,"got it thanks, this is first the time I've seen it this way. @Sonju lol I learn some thing new with HTML today. =)"
1074,@548afa42db8155e6700de70f Never ending... :)
1075,true story 
1076,"Oo  chicago, my daughter is in northern maine, are you all going to be in another snowmaggedon this year?"
1077,"delightfully painful. @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 Yes, I moved my comments to style { and it worked. Thanks"
1078,"Wouldn't $(""button"").click(function(){});    be the same as $(""button"").on('click', function(){});?"
1079,I’m less knowledgeable about jQuery :) but yes it appears to be
1080,"code $(""button"").click();"
1081,smm
1082,hmm*
1083,that didn't work as planned.
1084,"however, you will find that if you don’t write it how they tell you to, it wont pass"
1085,'code' $('button')
1086,its suppose to be three ``` then a space

1126,@54a60b0cdb8155e6700e4d43 What specifically have you been learning?

1128,"@548cf43edb8155e6700dee42 I knew HTML and CSS but I've been brushing up on that and I'm on to Javascript now, aiming for Ruby next, eventually, and then ALL THE THINGS"

1238,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 Often times web designers and developers are not one in the same. There are times where there are just designers and developers separate. However I heard once on a podcast that that is mostly big companies that do it due to their ability to afford having as many employees.

1264,Ty all

1266,"Also just joined as well, pleasure to make your acquaintances."
1267,@548cf43edb8155e6700dee42 How does pairing work?

1269,"Well, we use an app to share screens. The standard one around these parts is ScreenHero but I have skype as well. That way I can see your screen and perhaps see something you're not seeing."
1270,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 yeah actually I can replicate blue being black for button elements on safari as well
1271,Sometimes a second set of eyes is all that is needed
1272,"that's true. I need to remake a skype account. But, ill do that later. Ill just try to figure something out right now xD. But, thank you very much!"
1273,@54a60826db8155e6700e4d3e Interesting. Is it replicated in Firefox also? Are you using any frameworks?
1274,Gosh community is so nice lol
1275,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 Sure! Take a look at screenhero - they have a free 14-day trial.
1276,@548cf43edb8155e6700dee42 Thank you
1277,"@54a60826db8155e6700e4d3e same offer goes for you - if you want a second set of eyes, I have a few mins to pair up and see what's going on with your project"
1278,Should I use https://www.heroku.com/ to upload my portfolio?
1279,interesting - never used that site
1280,"Thanks Jeanette. It's not super important. I did break it down to the bare essentials with no external scripts and can confirm that, across all browsers, blue means black in the case of button objects."
1281,But not with other objects?
1282,Correct
1283,@54a60826db8155e6700e4d3e That is just weird. But if you're happy... :-)

1295,just don't understand the video
1296,It just goes over my head
1297,Then just try the challenges and use the slides. If you need to use the hints
1298,Which aspect Ammar ?
1299,"the ""data"" attribute: using it in jQuery"
1300,"Could you be a bit more specific Ammar, what about it are you having trouble understanding?"
1301,http://api.jquery.com/data/

1309,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 I'm not trying out any line: i said i'm just not nderstanding this video: http://try.jquery.com/levels/3/sections/16
1310,understanding*
1311,"Ah, understand now. I thought you were referencing one of the sections there specifically."
1312,wierd I couldn't use github to log into the forums so I just made an account
1313,It was acting wonky for me too. I ended up going into a thread and then it properly came up/allowed me to join.
1314,Nope. I guess i'm just not paying attention. I'll try again later
1315,"@547a9cd2db8155e6700d9676 That happened to me too. What I did is I moved to a different challenge, did other things for a few days. Then I went back to it and it made sense."
1316,Sometimes the brain just needs a break. 
1317,"So, javascript is the part of web coding that allows you to make webpages interactive and dynamic. And what that piece of javascript code does is allow you to take some object you have and give it ( or read from it) an internal value. Much to the same effect as $(""name"").text() or $(""name"").text(""Ammar""), but internally"
1318,@548cf43edb8155e6700dee42 I've decided that too. I'm going on a jQuery break and i'll just mess around with html/css for a few days

1415,my html file is in dekstop
1416,*desktop
1417,"that's OK, just put everything in one folder with a subfolder named img"

1436,"@54a67738db8155e6700e4e58 to make it easier, put your html file in your folder for example. html/index.html then in the style you can write background: url(""img/filename.png"") Hope this helps"
1437,you need /folder/folder/file.extension
1438,Hello guys
1439,Hello @54a56eb0db8155e6700e4af8!
1440,I am looking to acquire a person domain for bio / resume / etc; can anyone recommend a name generator they are partial to?
1441,I get to set up my whole dev environment again today! Woot!
1442,did you get a new mac yesterday @546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 ?
1443,We got a new one a couple weeks ago and I was going to just connect my MBP via thunderbolt but the iMac is too old
1444,"So, I will be setting it up and syncing via dropbox"
1445,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 those kind of chores can be fun in a way though
1446,fresh clean fast fun!
1447,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 I agree :)
1448,I’m guessing you’ll be installing meteor ;)
1449,of course :)
1450,I need it for work ;)
1451,ah more news? full-time?
1452,still not full-time. Gunna pass on the non-paying client to someone else and focus on the paying-client because his project is much more interesting to me
1453,and the client will be making a final decision about the investment by next week
1454,"So, hopefully full-time soon"
1455,hoping for/with you
1456,"hopefully ""employee"" status soon so I don't have to deal with self-employment stuff lol"
1457,who’d you convince to take the other project?
1458,@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a Mentioned he was interested
1459,good good
1460,I know things are busy but in a few weeks or so we should look at one of the non profits perhaps
1461,"ya, So I need to talk to him today and see if he for sure wants to do it and then talk to the client and break the news to him lol"
1462,"@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 I haven't done any of the MEAN stuff on fcc yet :/ but starting next week, my schedule will be more regular. About 25hrs/week on the paying project, so the rest of the time I can fill it in with FCC"
1463,"well, with no commitment of money there’s really no contract. Food on the table helps increase generosity "
1464,haha
1465,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 no reason we *have* to do it with mean
1466,ya
1467,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 I definitely would do it with Meteor :)
1468,"@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 , my only issue is finding time to be able to dedicate to working on a project for someone...something that isn't my own thing that I can just do at leisure"
1469,I have a wedding that i filmed back in October that I still need to edit and getting an 8 hour block of time to really dig into it is almost unheard of in my life right now
1470,"@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a well, you'll get lots of experience with this project. So you could hold off on the personal projects for a bit :) or use those as a break from the bigger project"
1471,@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a Where do you work again?
1472,Costco.com
1473,oh ya :)
1474,Issaquah
1475,@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a lol... I wish I could hear people trying to pronounce that right now lol
1476,or puyallup
1477,"haha, for sure"
1478,lol
1479,"Well, either way, I think i'm going to have to let the client know today that I'm not going to be able to do his proejct"
1480,and coding a project at work isn't much of an option at this time of year
1481,:(
1482,no worries
1483,has anyone seen @546fe471db8155e6700d6f0f around lately? Maybe he'd be interested
1484,any chance this weekend I could get a couple people to pair up with me and work out a couple bugs for the Live show?
1485,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 I’ve not lately.
1486,"@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 weird, i haven't seen him in a while"
1487,"@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 Ya, the last time I chatted with him was Dec 23rd"
1488,according to gitter :)
1489,@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a I’d like to but can’t commit right now
1490,@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a you live in issaquah?
1491,"@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 North Seattle, I commute to Issaquah"
1492,ah
1493,there’s an excellent kayaking academy there run by a guy named george gronseth
1494,very excited to be moving back to WA later this year
1495,@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a I used to make that same commute to Boeing... bless your soul haha
1496,@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a I was in a band that practiced in mukilteo/lynwood area. I had to commute there every friday afternoon from Bonney Lake. if I left 5 minutes too late i would get stuck in all the traffic heading north on I-5 towards seattle. It was terrible. Took me 3 hours one time to go like 10 miles lol
1497,I-5 traffic is the worst you're better off parking on the highway and walking :smile:
1498,haha. seriously
1499,"Yeah, luckily my journey is the opposite of most of the traffic flow. I would dread to have to drive INTO Seattle everyday. And I'm in a Vanpool, so its literally a free ride for me."
1500,but that time I literally left a few minutes late and got stuck in it. I usually was able to make it in a normal amount of time
1501,nice!
1502,I work in Poulsbo so its a easy ferry ride to bainbridge island and there is no traffic on this side of the water
1503,I really need to get to WA to visit. I miss it a ton
1504,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 Have you thought about doing remote work out here I'm sure there is a demand for some iOS dev's in Seattle
1505,"@547125dedb8155e6700d72ed I'm doing remote work now for a client in California. So I *could* move anywhere. Only problem is, my wife has deep deep deeeeep roots here in Minneapolis."
1506,but she is slowly starting to open up to the idea of moving.
1507,I didn’t think roots went that deep in permafrost
1508,haha
1509,;)
1510,lmao
1511,trust the guy from Alaska on that

1519,"@547125dedb8155e6700d72ed She has already said she'd be more open to it if I get a good job out there. but if i'm working remote then that won't matter. So, we'll see how things go. We don't own a house yet so as far as I'm concerned, we're pretty mobile."

1541,@547125dedb8155e6700d72ed Toronto's okay. I live in Ottawa which is not far away from there.

1549,morning all
1550,"Stayed up late, knocked out the JS codeschool stuff, now play around with some regex (which I already love, so should be easy) than on to some pair programming."
1551,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 hells yeah. i gots to be sharpening my sword to cut into that little ditty
1552,haha
1553,that's where I found that project i was telling you about
1554,i was just getting ready to ask
1555,I've got to master this: http://make8bitart.com/
1556,haha
1557,Hello World!
1558,"I found freecodecamp via a reddit post about learning front end dev.
http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2qxn6d/i_want_to_be_an_employable_frontend_developer_in/"
1559,"I am a web/graphic designer and would like to learn front end development so that I can implement my designs, and create my own projects. I'm interested in learning angular, as it's the preferred front end framework at my job."
1560,Welcome @54a6b987db8155e6700e4f94
1561,Thanks @54987ee2db8155e6700e2207
1562,hey all! sorry i was UAL happy new year!
1563,WooHoo! @546fe471db8155e6700d6f0f is back!
1564,Morning folks :)
1565,hello all
1566,Howdy @54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 @54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72
1567,What's the word on the streets?
1568,Heys...I'm playing around with codepen...got to thinking 
1569,I wonder if freecodecamp has considered adding a challenge to to make a little project on codepen and share it for review from other campers.   Add the challenge around 30 when you've finished Codeacademy and Jquery.  Would be a nice review of everything to implement it.
1570,I think would be cool way to force yourself to implement some of the tools in a easy project.
1571,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 there are lots of things that people can share early on. Like the projects from the Dash courses
1572,:)
1573,"@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a Not much, getting some coding in before the semester starts next week. making a list of resources for an Independent study that I'm on Spatio-Temporal visualizations of Tweets on infectious diseases."
1574,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 I just think it might be neat to have it part of a challenge.
1575,... to both do an easy project AND to share it on chat or forum for critique.
1576,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 ... that sounds very nerdy. I like it. Good luck with that.
1577,Hahaha. Thanks. I'm getting a journal article out of it so I'm quite happy. Especially since it's my last semester and thennnnnn graduated!
1578,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 I think that's a good idea. I've found that it's way harder to get started on your own little project than just following the instructions codecademy/dash/try jquery give you
1579,@54a0623ddb8155e6700e37b5 Hey ya...yes thats my exact problem.  I'm not sure the best way to go about starting.  I've been looking at some simple programs like timers and calculators on codepen and trying to understand them and make adjustments to them.  The blank screen is a little intimidating.
1580,good morning CodeCampers
1581,hulloo
1582,whats everyone working on
1583,Morning :)
1584,Morning @54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6
1585,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 I found out that my iMac is too old to use a thunderbolt cable to connect my MBP, so i'm setting up my dev environment again. Yippee"
1586,oh fun!
1587,haha
1588,the fun part will be figuring out how to sync the two computers so that I can easily switch between them
1589,heh let me know if you get that part worked out :)
1590,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 It most likely will have something to do with dropbox
1591,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 I asked a few days ago if imaging a dev environment is a good idea for FCC stuff. Seems like you just answered my question. :)
1592,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 I just keep my code up in github repos and make regular pushes so I can swap between computers if need be. Also Evernote + dropbox ftw.
1593,"Question for everybody actually....does anyone have experience mining tweets with Python, either using libraries or just using the twitter api straight with oauth?"
1594,"Playing around on the regex assignment, which I've always thought was so cool. You get 100% workable code that ends up looking like... (\d{4})x(\d{3}\d?)"
1595,"@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 Ya, I could do that but some stuff is not on github. It'd be great to be able to just clone a repo on one computer and then my dropbox-synced folders will update it and i'll have it on both :)"
1596,then i don't have to worry about if I left my desktop computer and forgot to push my changes to github before I go to the coffee shop and work on my laptop
1597,good idea
1598,Si :)
1599,"Anyway, point of the python question above, is I've used Tweepy in the past and had to standardize the times coming in of tweets because otherwise it wonked things up. I'm thinking that's the nature of the tweet object and not a feature of the tweepy library itself, but was wanting to double check with someone else (presuming anyone knows :) )"
1600,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 Can you repeat the question?
1601,"@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 Sorry, heh, that was a bit disjointed. Okay so I'm working with the Twitter streaming api with Python. You can either use oauth to access the api directly or use a library (like Tweepy) to access it. The api returns a JSON object, however (at least with Tweepy) the time field (when the thing was tweeted) is not the same...obviously because people can be tweeting from different time-zones. So in the past I've had to write something up to clean up this time field, if you will. I'm hoping someone else here is similarly familiar with this to determine whether or not this is an issue with other twitter libraries and/or directly using oauth, or if this is an issue with Tweepy itself?"
1602,Actually more that I think about it...it probably doesn't matter and I'll want to clean the time anyway....I think I'm going to be using both the search and streaming api's..../ponder
1603,"@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 Usually on API's like that, they standardize the time. like GMT +- 0"
1604,so each time zone would be GMT -6 or whatever
1605,but everything should come in order streaming wise
1606,"@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 One would think that, but at least using a particular library it isn't...Then again it returns a JSON object that's a little different from the twitter JSON object so who knows what crud they are doing."
1607,"That's certainly true, regarding coming in order....however I'm cleaning the data from the api, sticking it in a database, and then running analysis on it. Specifically ones based on space and time, then visualizing it. So accurate time/dates are pretty important for me."
1608,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 What does the time format look like for an object? can you post an example here?
1609,"time zones shouldn't matter about ""when"" it happened. it will always be in order"
1610,"I'm not just gathering data from the streaming api, but also from the historical search api."
1611,can you post an example of some of the dates of objects you're getting?
1612,"Oh sure, I'm just trying to not destroy chat with a massive JSON post :P"
1613,just pick a couple tweets and take out just the date object from each of them and post only the dates here
1614,"{""created_at"":""Tue Dec 09 22:46:58 +0000 2014"",

{""created_at"":""Tue Dec 09 22:46:58 +0000 2014"",""
{""created_at"":""Tue Dec 09 22:46:58 +0000 2014"",""

{""created_at"":""Tue Dec 09 22:46:58 +0000 2014"","
1615,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 a pastebin link is sufficiently small for the chat in the case of a large amount of blob
1616,"I know it's not much, but that 1 second weirdness above has caused issues (errors) in the past."
1617,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 can you use something https://storify.com/ to keep all your tweets together?
1618,how are you parsing the date?
1619,"They are going to be cleaned (probably only grabbing time/date, location, text fields) and then put into a database. We haven't decided on relational v. nosql yet."
1620,"I'm doing Ch. 2.1 of the Chrome Dev Tools challenge. Does anyone know what this means: ""Inspect the ""Run 5K"" event, find its "".event"" CSS declaration, and link from there to the corresponding location in the stylesheet.""
http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/2/challenges/2"
1621,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 I would try working with the streaming api directly. Seems as though the lib you are using is not working properly
1622,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 Yeah that's what I was thinking.
1623,"but other than that, everything is based off of GMT +0000 so you don't need to worry about time zones"
1624,just making sure the data is in order
1625,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 Check this out: http://jessefreeman.com/articles/dropbox-for-developers/
1626,"@548503dfdb8155e6700dccd0 Hey, you need to ""right-click"" on the ""Run 5K"" element, then select the ""Inspect element"" option. It will automatically highlight that line of code in DevTool.
Then on the right window in DevTool you need to click on link that navigates you to CSS code of the inspected element."
1627,@54a0ace5db8155e6700e38bf Wow. Thank you! I could not figure out which link they were referring to.
1628,@548503dfdb8155e6700dccd0 No problem. Altough I recommend you to rewatch the video a couple of times before doing the actual challenge if you aren't sure how to complete it.
1629,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 Thanks for that article about Dropbox
1630,Lots of good info there

1677,Just because bacon enhances many things does not mean it should be included with all foods. Think of it like a fine food 'wine' to be eaten in moderation lest one tires of it.

1703,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 What?
1704,"@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 in name only, really"
1705,it still uses their old busted rendering engine
1706,@54a4b680db8155e6700e491e Yeah
1707,At least it's not IE 6 - 8 :p
1708,"I think it's only going to create confusion because they're shipping this new thing (called Spartan) with IE 11 on Windows 10...you know, the newest version of Windows after Windows 8"
1709,They should just give up LOL
1710,sounds good to me :)
1711,Of course it's going to cause confusion. When has Microsoft ever made a seemingly 'big' change like this when it hasn't caused confusion?
1712,They should just stick to making xbox and related things

1715,I actually like IE.
1716,!!!
1717,Actually no. Let's keep Windows around. It distracts the hackers/virus makers from making more crap to target linux/mac.
1718,"@54a4b680db8155e6700e491e Yeah, hopefully"

1725,@5498c06adb8155e6700e233b How about http://jquery.com/
1726,"and the main problem with IE is that when Mozilla and Webkit agree on something, it seems like the IE people go ""well, how about we do it this completely different way?"""
1727,Microsoft still needs to support the large Enterprise market that can't handle upgrading browsers every six months.
1728,"Too many Enterprise tools still support IE 8, Our phone recording software we have from Cisco won't run on anything but IE8 and we just bought the thing!"
1729,I use software at my dumb office job that still relies on ActiveX :(

1731,Yes lol. Working on the first lesson in code school and having to google to learn the proper commands
1732,@5498c06adb8155e6700e233b  folks are happy to help here or in Help chat room...if you are stuck on a question
1733,"There's the issue Microsoft still needs to support those companies that won't give up old tech. They can't just remove it. They've tried. With Win 8 they wanted to break from the old system, but too many people complained and they pulled it back in. The idea with two browsers is to have one current and one legacy."
1734,"I get that, but to me that feels like they keep fracturing their user base again and again, and eventually it's a big mess and everyone has to support 5 simultaneous versions of software"
1735,I have the same apprehensions about Android...just looking at version requirements on apps gives me a headache
1736,"They also have a user base many times the size of any other platform (I'm talking Desktop, I understand mobile and Server is different)"
1737,Hello world! I'm looking forward to becoming more involved in FreeCodeCamp!
1738,welcome to our community @54a6eaa7db8155e6700e50c0
1739,Thanks @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97
1740,@5498c06adb8155e6700e233b i also use http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ ....for quick questions...but some say its not doesnt always follow best practices.
1741,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 It definitely doesnt
1742,Welcome @54a6eaa7db8155e6700e50c0 !
1743,"@54a25226db8155e6700e3e0b very true, but I would say that with the world migrating more and more to consumption on mobile devices (via Safari, Chrome and such) that dominance may begin to waver"
1744,@sircharleswatson but for just the basics it has been helpful to me i believe
1745,w3schools is listed as a no-no resources on r/learnprogramming
1746,Mozilla Developer Network is overall a better resource
1747,+1 for Moz Dev Network.
1748,"Yep, even Microsoft understands that. HTML/CSS/JS can be used to write what they call ""modern"" apps, Or what most people call Metro. I think that is very smart of them."
1749,but much more difficult and intimidating for a noob
1750,"but w3schools gets a really bad rep, most of the stuff they have on there is fine"
1751,I think most people get irritated (rightfully so) that their name falsely indicates that they have something to do with the W3C
1752,I like the tools over at w3schools. The testing areas and such.
1753,i think maybe ok to use it with a grain of salt?  and plan on switching to moz dev as sooon as feasible?
1754,yes the testing area is great
1755,S/O to @547292dadb8155e6700d7728  for the chief keef meme :smile: haha

1776,do potential employers actually look at this certification: http://www.ciwcertified.com/Certifications/index.php
1777,Frist time I've heard of it.
1778,From what I've seen...employers in Web development care about what you can do not what cert or degree you have (there are exceptions of course)
1779,I've seen a lot of job postings and have not seen those credentials required as of yet. 
1780,And I've never heard of that cert before.

1790,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 wait...aren't you unemployed?
1791,:)
1792,"As for what they look at in jobs in web dev, I have had a few interviews that required a portfolio that showed what you could do, and a lot of questions asking what I've worked in, and one had a short coding question. "
1793,I found Free Code Camp by reading blogs. I learned basic coding by taking CS50x from Edx. I want to go the next level with javascript and that is why I am here. Cheers!
1794,@547664a9db8155e6700d8846 thank you for the heads up
1795,"@54a6f10ddb8155e6700e50e0 woohoo! We're glad to have you, my friend."
1796,"here is a question, what about coding do you guys enjoy?"
1797,hello world.... :) today is my first day here..
1798,@54a6f13bdb8155e6700e50e4 Welcome
1799,@54a6f13bdb8155e6700e50e4 @54a6f10ddb8155e6700e50e0  Welcome to FCC
1800,"@548afa42db8155e6700de70f for me, it feels like magic taking these weird incantations and turning that into something that works"
1801,Hi there @54a6f13bdb8155e6700e50e4 welcome to FCC
1802,"For getting ready for Interviews, I would like to recommend a site. Interview Cake. It gives you coding questions you might get asked as a programmer for work. Some of the questions might not be in your wheelhouse yet but it gives you an idea. "
1803,"Awesome site, thanks."
1804,I felt the same way. although my web dev is not all that perfect. My creativity is in my head but when I apply it to the web world it doesn't come out straight. but hey! practice. I realize that don't do well with a lot of people and I get more of a satisfaction with the computers. 
1805,Can you still do webdev if youre not really good at design
1806,"@5470cd71db8155e6700d71a6 absolutely! I mean, most backend devs do zero visual design"
1807,of course
1808,yes
1809,web developer != web designer
1810,precisely
1811,that's what bootstrap is for
1812,"there's crossover between both roles, but they're distinct, and there's plenty of people that do 100% one or the other"
1813,oh ok
1814,EdX is starting a Intro to Linux class on Jan 5. It's from Linux Foundation.  I know I need some knowledge about Linux to work with Web Sites and hosting. I was wondering if someone knew if  this class could give me what I'd need?
1815,"Web Designers and Web Developers can be two different positions. However, you will find most companies loving to get a two-fer while only paying for one body. I used to work exclusively in design but I find being able to do both makes you much more enticing!"
1816,"@5470cd71db8155e6700d71a6 if you would specialize in Rails or Django or other backend stuff, you'll probably never touch Photoshop or Illustrator throughout your entire career"
1817,I see
1818,"And as someone who focuses more on the design aspects of things, we need people who don't know design but can program better than we could ever imagine"
1819,"Originally from Puerto Rico, live in Boston but currently in Hamburg to relocate to Berlin :D"
1820,"Currently piggy-backing on a spotty 3G hotspot from a random supermarket SIM so not sure if things are getting through, but just wanted to say I'm looking forward to getting started with FCC. Thanks to the folks who put the time into building something like this!"
1821,"welcome, @54a6f60adb8155e6700e510c!"
1822,"ah, looks like I'm getting through! thank you @54a4b680db8155e6700e491e!"

1827,Very nice
1828,@546fd823db8155e6700d6eb4 awesome stuff! ...and a reminder why JS tends to confuse a ton of people :)
1829,"Have we looked at using the CS50 course from Harvard? It's a pretty good start that does cover a little bit more then just Web dev, but would be a good intro to Comp Sci.."
1830,"@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 seconded on CS50, the professor is really engaging, makes things fun"
1831,Hello world... I guess! :D How're you guys doing? I'm excited to see where this is going. This site already seems to be one of the more friendlier places of the internet. :)
1832,@54a6fd5adb8155e6700e5145 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WE'RE FRIENDLY?!?!?!!!?!?!?!?!?
1833,"I for one am not friendly...they just force me to be a shell of myself here....
"
1834,I just don' think @54a6fd5adb8155e6700e5145 knows we all serve under the Dark Lord Sauron...the spell must be working
1835,"so @54a6fd5adb8155e6700e5145, welcome, what kind of stuff do you want to make?"
1836,"I will be so glad to be over this jquery section. The teaching method annoys me something fierce...
"
1837,"@54a4b680db8155e6700e491e Hah, you're cute, little fairies compared to some communities I've seen... I just wanna get a little deeper into webdev. The past years I've always done some simple stuff on the web (html, css, copy&paste php :D) and I enjoy it a hell lot."
1838,"@54a6fd5adb8155e6700e5145 this seems like an awesome place to start, and, yes, it's a very welcoming place from the time I've spent here"
1839,"@54a6fd5adb8155e6700e5145 I'm in the same place you are, I've messed around with development stuff here and there for a little while, but I've only recently wanted to get really serious about it"
1840,@Lumiras A lot of the information used to be disgustingly inaccurate. They have since updated a lot. but I still wouldnt trust it :P (w3schools)
1841,@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 We chose the stanford cs101 course because it uses javascript
1842,Good Afternoon Code Campers. I couldn't sleep last night. Ended up watching almost all of season 2 Orange is the New Black. Janeway is one of the main characters.
1843,"I need a dish washing minion, when is Sauron getting me one of those huh?"
1844,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 I figured it was something along those lines. Just was wondering..
1845,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a How did you like Season 2? I didn't like it as much as the first
1846,Yeah I really like her in that role Steven
1847,Should I do the optional videos on the stanford course
1848,"@54a4b680db8155e6700e491e Yeah. I've never really had the chance to learn coding, but about a year ago I've discovered some longer tutorials on YouTube, then the Microsoft Virtual Academy and a few days ago I found out about FCC and I think now is the perfect time to, as you say, get really serious about it."
1849,"I love that @547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a assumes he's among a crowd who will immediately know who ""Janeway"" is. ;D"
1850,oh lets not pretend we don't :)

1857,Actually through twitter. Ive been coding for about 3 months now and want to expand my knowledge
1858,So im super excited
1859,"fantastic, I'm glad you found your way here"
1860,what language have you been working in?
1861,@547677e7db8155e6700d8895 @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 Red is great. I watched Season 1 when it was fairly new. It's been so long between the end of Season 1 and now watching Season 2 that I was just happy to be back with the characters. I am enjoying the back stories and I think V is a great addition.
1862,Looks like a fantastic site
1863,Just basic html and css
1864,I think I will watch the rest before I start working because otherwise I will think about it all day long. :)

1866,lol
1867,Hi everyone discovering FreecodeCamp great idea ( in France we something similar called Simplon.co ) 
1868,welcome @54a70b10db8155e6700e5195
1869,@54a7065edb8155e6700e5173 How have you been learning during those 3 months? I’ve been learning for about the same amount of time
1870,but I was glad to find FCC
1871,nice to meet you @546fda59db8155e6700d6ece
1872,likewise!
1873,@54a70b10db8155e6700e5195 Greetings and welcome to FCC!
1874,I've been learning through treehouse but It kind of feels its missing a community so I decided joined  FCC yesterday
1875,glad to have you
1876,it’s nice to have the FreeCodeCamp/Help channel when you’re stuck on something
1877,"I've tried Treehouse before, I get what you mean :)"
1878,be sure to make use of that once you’ve tried to work through the problem amply on your own
1879,"good content, but not much of a community "
1880,Is treehouse any good? I've been looking at starting on there too
1881,The content is quite good from what I've worked through thus far.
1882,yea they high production content with great teachers
1883,They also update a tremendous amount.
1884,"I joined FCC a couple of weeks ago, but not had much time to work through the material so far - have they got rid of the 'bitballoon' exercises right at the start? I'm seeing links to General Assembly's 'Dash' course instead now? "
1885,"(I quite like Codeschool too, btw - I'm doing their Frontend Foundations course at the moment)"
1886,"@5488ec3edb8155e6700ddecb Ya, there was an overhaul of the challenges a couple weeks ago"
1887,most of the stuff is all the same
1888,Ahhh. 
1889,yea codeschool is great too but I would say treehouse has better instructors
1890,@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 that's why treehouse is a paid service
1891,I think treehouse cover a wider range of topics too
1892,"so is codeschool, they just a some free content aswell"
1893,man I can't type complete sentances today
1894,Code school has paid content too
1895,"Code school tends to focus on more higher end content, specifically oriented around development. "
1896,"Treehouse has design, business, etc as well."
1897,"And is more oriented around a well rounded approach to learning. That being said their mid level dev/high end dev content is much sparser then Codeschool. Also it tends to be in 'workshop' form, meaning it requires a gold membership"
1898,Another resource (imo better then code school) is https://frontendmasters.com/courses/ 
1899,@keyframes not supported in an inline or scoped stylesheet in Firefox
1900,thats why my robot doesn't have red eyes
1901,disapointed

1910,@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 I had many problems with the Dash tasks running javascript correctly. You can always check your stuff in Codepen to see if it's correct.
1911,"Just switched over to chrome, all is good now"
1912,caniuse.com is great 
1913,The first task for every lesson in the Chrome Dev Tools course is always completed before I start it. Anyone else see this?
1914,"@548503dfdb8155e6700dccd0 yup, it's a bug relaoding the page fixes the problem"
1915,Thanks

1924,"I just heard the phrase ""a lot of API usage these days."" Can someone explain an example of all this usage"
1925,"There are a lot of companies, organizations, etc that produce data API’s that then developers will tend to use. For example you want to integrate twitter into your application, you need to use their API."
1926,"Same thing goes for things like 4square, Facebook logins, etc."

1944,@54a4cf6edb8155e6700e4961 in that particular assignment I believe they want it in the <style> tag in the <head>.
1945,When actuallllly coding you’re going to want to put all your CSS in stylesheets so it’s not in your HTML pages at all.
1946,(ie when not doing a site like Dash)
1947,Does that answer your question @54a4cf6edb8155e6700e4961 ?
1948,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 Thanks for the reply Ben.

1950,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 Yes it does. I had a long reply typed out trying to further clarify my question but then looked at the code again and realized what you meant. I made the correction to my code and the color for <h1> is now under style. Thanks!

1953,"hey im trying to rewrite javascipts pop method
i saw the code from the V8 engine but they were using functions that im not familiar with
i wanted to know if there was a simple way to write it
the only thing i am stuck on is mutating the original array
for ex
 ```
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.pop();
console.log(arr)
// output [1,2]
```
how do i get it to remove the element from the arr variable"
1954,
1955,Not sure what you expected to happen Mychael. That is the correct output for the pop function called on your array
1956,http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1796-javascript-array-methods-unshift-shift-push-and-pop.htm
1957,hello world
1958,@54a74325db8155e6700e525b Howdy!
1959,yo yo
1960,For those of you far enough to be into Node.js development. Enjoy this article. And may it save you time!!! https://www.airpair.com/node.js/posts/top-10-mistakes-node-developers-make
1961,"not a bad article, but if you follow the node tutorial on codeschool and nodeschool you should **never** be doing some of those things anyway"
1962,@54a74325db8155e6700e525b hi welcome!
1963,"@547017dfdb8155e6700d6fd2 ""how do i get it to remove the element from the arr variable"" which element are you referring to specifically?"
1964,the last element of the array
1965,.pop() is the correct function for that. It removes the last item. Are you trying to remove it and use it instead of doing away with it altogether? 
1966,"The code you pasted above will change your array into [1, 2] as you noted but if you want to use the '3' consider assigning the pop() method to a variable."
1967,why in codeschool tryJQuery do the slides show single quotes but then exercises require double quotes?
1968,They actually make you do double quotes? I’ve never seen Codeschool enforce things that tough.
1969,Strictly*
1970,"yes the answers are in double quotes, not sure if that's why I get some of the coding wrong but the answer is always different then the slides that show single quotes"
1971,"Realistically it doesn’t matter, apparently outside their overly strict validator."
1972,From a coding perspective I mean.
1973,so in jQuery single quotes or double quotes are the same?
1974,"$(document).ready(function() {
 $('button').on('click', function() {
 var price = $('<p>From $399.99</p>');
 $('.vacation').append(price);
application.js
The price will be appended to both
.vacation elements
3.3 Refactor Using Traversing

ul
DOCUMENT
li
p
class=""vacation""
li
p
class=""vacation""
div id=""vacations""
Every button will be removed
$('button').remove();
});
}); from the slide"
1975,"from the answer (not the exact exercise):$(document).ready(function(){
  $(""button"").on(""click"", function(){
    var message = $(""<span>Call 1-555-jquery-air to book this tour</span>"");
    $(this).closest("".tour"").append(message);
    $(this).remove();
  });
});"
1976,So
1977,"Realistically it will function with either “ or ‘. Looking into it more, Jquery recommends using """
1978,"Reasoning being that something like: 
alert('Say ""Hello""');
alert(""Say 'Hello'"");"
1979,Actually Google's Javascript style guide single quotes are preferred when creating strings: https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml?showone=Strings#Strings
1980,Which I always find strange.
1981,soooo why wouldn't the slides teach the recommended/correct way
1982,The second one reads easier. Also if you start working with JSON it requires “. So for consistencies sake...
1983,Because ultimately it’s the programmers preference.
1984,The slides may have been prepared by someone different from the challenge
1985,Also many other languages require double quotes.
1986,"Which is why I always feel bothered when using single quotes for strings in JavaScript or Python, for instance."
1987,"strange, I can't be the only one confused by this.  Double quotes make more sense to me."
1988,"Essentially Javascript is incredibly lax, so much so that you can hang yourself. (Like with == vs === )"
1989,And people do their own weird things with the language.
1990,I typically only use single quotes when I'm feeling too lazy to hold shift. Other than that I use doubles when there's a likely hood of my creating a string.
1991,I can't recall if I was specifically dinged for the quotes but  just find it annoying the teaching slides and the answers don't match.
1992,I don't recall having the issue of the slides not matching
1993,If you ever want to see something really annoying/weird with JS try this:
1994,http://try.jquery.com/levels/3/sections/15  look at the slides and then look at the answers but I did cut and paste it above
1995,(0.1 + 0.2) === 0.3;
1996,You can look at any of the slides and answers none of them match
1997,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 what will that do?
1998,Come back with a False.
1999,Because JS is neurotic.
2000,"interesting, and you are being marked wrong for not using double quotes?"
2001,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6  That's floating point rounding error. It plagues more languages than JS.
2002,Which others out of curiosity? I mainly work with JS and python so it’s a quirk of JS to me.
2003,Did the node.js tutorials at codeschool use to be free?
2004,"It's does the same thing in Python, I just checked."
2005,Really?
2006,Yeah.
2007,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 I'm not 100% sure anymore my brain hurts from jQuery.  But I did either pass or fail and continue on only to see the answers were double quotes
2008,I….how the heck did I never notice this.
2009,It's not a language thing though. It's more of a CS thing. Has to do with the fact that you can't represent fractional decimal numbers in binary very well.
2010, /nods
2011,It's like how 1/3 = 0.333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333

2064,Agreed. Structure and an active community who is working through things at the same time as you are is very helpful.

2077,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6  Cool.

2216,Watching his Rosetta reenactment now.
2217,Seems like a good way to decompress from Coderbyte challenges.
2218,"yeah, they’re kind of nice. I’ve been following his interstellar quest series since he began it over a year ago now"
2219,the CodeSchool node.js is not as fun as I had hoped
2220,"I don't think CodeSchool has done a great job of explaining thing, imho"
2221,@5466246ddb8155e6700d4a1a nodeschool.io does a good job I feel
2222,Codeschool is rly tough
2223,"ok, i'm calling it a night"
2224,g'night everyone
2225,Can I get some feed back on my portfolio site. I'm trying to land and internship so I'm trying to create a portfolio site. Here is what I have so far https://nameless-garden-5870.herokuapp.com/resume

2256,Sorry Hi All!
2257,"@548c4ffedb8155e6700dec9b Hey there, what's the exact issue, next slide doesn't appear?"
2258,The slideshow will not start 
2259,what browser and version are you using?

2267,@54a7c60ddb8155e6700e53ca hey!
2268,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478  what?
2269,"```
function ipToInt32(ip){
  return parseInt(ip.toString().split('.').map(function(num) {
    return '00000000'.substr(Number(num).toString(2).length) + Number(num).toString(2);
  }).join(''), 2);
}
```"
2270,haha
2271,I really do love JS
2272,:confused: 
2273,it converts an ipv4 internet address into its true 32 bit integer form
2274,I'm almost out of Internet data
2275,the irony of JS is that is it's not beginner friendly but becomes easy to use when you're better at it
2276,oooh someone else wrote a great solution I didn’t even think about
2277,how does it look
2278,"elegant, I didn’t realize you could split numbers into an array using the split() function, makes sense now though"
2279,"`return ip.split(""."").reduce(function(int,v){ return int*256 + +v } );`"
2280,you can use .split() on a Number data type?
2281,can't find that in the api
2282,it looks like it converts it to an array of strings
2283,given the notation on v
2284,"not terribly memory efficient, but it works!"
2285,"available to pair if anyone wants to work on their coderbyte challenges or anything else, really"
2286,"I'm working on the last two FCC challenges now, want to finish that first before doing coderbyte"
2287,"maybe a bit later if you're still available, or if someone else grabs you first :smile: "
2288,@5498c6a6db8155e6700e2349 sure
2289,"I recall you mentioning that you don't like angular.js that much and that you prefer meteor instead, why is that?"
2290,@5498c6a6db8155e6700e2349 that’s @546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 I believe
2291,I like angular just fine
2292,"ahh then I was confused, saw you both chatting about it"
2293,"angular seems pretty neat, need to practice a bit to get a feeling for using directives, controllers etc."
2294,yeah
2295,I like angular alot actually
2296,hello world!
2297,@54a7e71fdb8155e6700e5446 hello
2298,Nice :-D
2299,second challenge done. only 998 left :-P
2300,lol
2301,hullooo all
2302,hello world! :smile: 
2303,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478  is that a badger on your avatar?  cool photo!  I thought it was at first high heel shoe from thumbnail.
2304,@54a7ef79db8155e6700e5464  hi ya welcome
2305,"@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 yep, it’s a badger, though that’s an old photo and the new one isn’t populating across gitter it seems"
2306,Good day everyone!
2307,ive never seen a live badger unfortunately just ones on road :worried: 
2308,hey ya @54a0623ddb8155e6700e37b5
2309,haha are ya cold i norge?
2310,its warmed up here in småland actually all the snow melted on new years day
2311,I'm actually in halland right now
2312,at my parents'
2313,ah ok did you get a lot of snow there on christmas_
2314,"it's really mild here, but we've had a lot of wind"
2315,no snow really
2316,yes here too really windy yesterday
2317,"I was down by the ocean yesterday, you could barely walk directly against the wind"
2318,"ah ok, we got quite a bit over christmas but now its gone"
2319,oh wow i bet
2320,@54a0623ddb8155e6700e37b5 any luck on starting on a small project? wasn't it you i was talking about difficulty starting yesterday?
2321,I made a simple static website to figure out how well I understand HTML/CSS
2322,positioning is a bit complicated still
2323,ah nice
2324,gonna add some functional buttons with jQuery to it next
2325,yes its harder once you start doing it yourself without bootstrap  etc
2326,nice
2327,though I've come to realize that I have no clue how to design a website
2328,yeah i get worried that you need to have an artistic eye
2329,plenty of inspiration in the interwebs
2330,but i think with practice can make some decent looking sites
2331,yeah definitely
2332,you don't have to be a designer if you don't want to as well
2333,yeah thats righ but maybe good start with html/css to get to know that part
2334,yeah I figured I didn't want to move forward without feeling relatively confident with it
2335,doesn't seem to be any more html/css later on in the challenges
2336,except for bootstrap
2337,ah yeah im thinking the same way...ive done 30+ of the challenges but I want to be sure to start using the stuff im learning so i dont forget it
2338,"yeah, remembering is the hard part"
2339,I'm taking this course now to help a little bit with that: https://www.coursera.org/course/learning
2340,"i think if you practice with it, it solidifies"
2341,ah nice do you like it?
2342,"haven't really started yet, gonna check out the first lectures today"
2343,but I've read good things about it
2344,"ah great, i wonder if there is stuff written on self-paced learning"
2345,the challenges you face when trying to educate yourself with online tools and books
2346,"probably not that much yet, since it's so new"
2347,all the research is focused on classical education when it comes to pedagogy
2348,i remember seeing a link on reddit that supposedly had a full CS degree that was available through different free courses online.  that would be amazing if someday that route is considered close to one from a real uni
2349,i also read that people sign up for MOOCs but that only 15% finish them
2350,sounds accurate
2351,it was something about that if you pay for a course your more likely to finish it
2352,I've never finished a MOOC course myself
2353,a good github profile and recommendations form actual work can be more valuable than a cs degree
2354,doesn't codeacadamy count? :-)
2355,"I guess, then I've finished two and a half :)"
2356,@terakilobyte I've heard that for sure
2357,Would you say that the Uni route is more common though for IT professionals?
2358,"I guess what Im saying is it would be cool, if there was a program one could follow online that would lead to work.  (maybe its freecodecamp?)"
2359,A CS degree offers a track to follow and you often are forced to do projects that can build your portfolio and give you experience.
2360,(but costs money)
2361,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 I was assigned a MOOC on web access ability at work.... over 500 signed up and about 5 people actually completed it (it required a bit of work most people weren't interested in doing!)
2362,"For myself and I imagine others, it's hard to create your own self-study track to get to a point where you have a strong github profile and are contributing to open source projects."
2363,"@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 So, yeah, thanks for the Scott Manley tip. I'm now catching up on the Interstellar videos while working challenges. :+1:"
2364,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 np
2365,"I’ve also been geeking out on old computers like bombe (ok not a computer), colossus, the apollo guidance, all that"
2366,amazing to think the average phone in a pocket is orders of magnitude more powerful than all those combined
2367,@54a0a9abdb8155e6700e38af  MOOCs are such a cool idea. It's like wow free education...sign me up!
2368,"Yeah, was gonna say, the Raspberry Pi sitting on my desk right now is like all of those times 1000"
2369,(especially if your from the US where education costs a fortune)
2370,"@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 I don’t think there are any non-traditional avenues that guarantee a job in any field. That said, hard work and talent will get you into any career field you choose, regardless of how you learn the material"
2371,"if you show that you are just **better**, it’s a no brainer for an employer"
2372,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 I completey agree.  I think its just hard for the average joe to organize one's self to self-teach.  I think it would be great if online resources really evolve to make it easier to self-teach.
2373,"Learning how to learn is the hardest step. Once you have that figured out you can get to pretty much anything you want. If you want an actual success story, I'm in the bay area working full-time as a firmware developer using C/C++ and the highest degree I hold is an Associates degree in Industrial Management. "
2374,"@seahik the benefit of choosing your own path is that you can determine what to focus on. You should want to broaden just to be a better person overall (aside from CS you should enroll in moocs that teach communication and math), but if you don’t care about neo-renaissance spackle painting, you won’t be forced to study it and drop a thousand in tuition"
2375,wow nice @iyeager2004  well done that is inspiring.  how did you go about it...how long did it take you to teach yourself C/C++?  did you take any courses or just from books?  How did you demostrate your expertise to employers?  did you have your own projects?
2376,"Thanks, all done through free resources and probably a little luck."
2377,ah my other mistress besides JS
2378,"plain jane, vanilla C"
2379,"C++ is just so, yucky"
2380,"C is as close as I ever want to get to writing assembly. But yeah, there's something so nice about being in control of every aspect of my application. It's like driving some awesome standard shift classic car."
2381,"or more like C is an expertly honed blade, C++ is the swish army knife with 85^7 implements and weighs eleventythrive millionty pounds"
2382,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 You actually learned C! WOW
2383,I *love* C
2384,although JS has now surpassed it for my favorite language
2385,I taught myself C from KnR
2386,"excellent book, I recommend everyone read it/work through it in their spare time"
2387,JS seems like fun. I'm enjoying playing around in jQuery. Just started the Node.js stuff.
2388,Node is awesome
2389,"and once you get the idea of closures, like really really get it, and that **everything** is an object"
2390,it just becomes magical
2391,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 one of my favorite programming books I've purchased
2392,JS in general. I just view node as a tool
2393,@54a0a9abdb8155e6700e38af it’s amazing comparing it to modern “learn to program” books
2394,"it’s just right to the point, with enough explanation to give you a warm fuzzy but leaving it open enough you have to do it yourself to really understand what they mean"
2395,and then understanding pointers and why they are amazing(ly awful if misused)
2396,"@547a9cd2db8155e6700d9676 why is that wow that I learned C, btw? :)"
2397,it also has tainted me to dislike python and ruby
2398,"it was amazing resource back when I was doing AVR development...actually thinking I could turn that into a career, but an incredibly fun hobby"
2399,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 C isn't Object Oriented
2400,It's a har language to learn
2401,haed*
2402,hard*
2403,"@547a9cd2db8155e6700d9676 on the contrary, I think procedural programming is much easier to learn initially"
2404,I tried C++
2405,Couldn't get it done
2406,Went with Python insted :D
2407,@547a9cd2db8155e6700d9676 how do you tie your shoes?
2408,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 I just learned that 4 years ago!
2409,"a bit rhetorical :) What I’m getting at is, you probably follow some procedure and manually tie them yourself vs. something like shoe.tie();"
2410,Why do you hate Python and Ruby?
2411,I like Python and plan on learning Ruby after jQuery
2412,"honestly? Call me petty, but I dislike their syntax"
2413,Python's syntax dtaes back to Algol 68 and Lua
2414,dates*
2415,"Ok, that does nothing to alter my dislike for the syntax though"
2416,It has a simple syntax why do you hate it
2417,because there’s something nice in defining blocks of execution within {}
2418,"```
print(""I'm Python!"")
```"
2419,it’s very clear
2420,No {} is good? 
2421,I’m not saying whether it is or isn’t absolutely. I’m saying personally I like the syntax of C style languages. I look for () {} as that’s what I’m used to
2422,C is influincing you too much
2423,I'm on firefox now
2424,My keyboard isn't working in chrome
2425,that's odd
2426,"@547a9cd2db8155e6700d9676 perhaps it is influencing you too little… and yeah, that’s strange"
2427,Back on Chrome
2428,Restarted my computer
2429,Good Morning Everyone
2430,good morning @54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9

2456,mhm

2506,@54a81998db8155e6700e553a These visualizations look beautiful. Have you put any visualizations on Plot.ly?
2507,"Aye! I started with GIS and then started playing around with web dev…and now I want to do web GIS. Figure I can branch out in either direction, GIS or dev."
2508,"Starting Monday, i'm returning to learning jQuery"
2509,"Thanks so much @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c! :) Nope, nothing up on Plot.ly yet. Could I put d3.js viz up there? @54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6, are you making progress in the bootcamp? How far are you?"
2510,"Up to #13, started yesterday. If you do d3.js stuff I don’t forsee you having any troubles :)"
2511,";) Well... I'm not so sure about that!... I get into trouble all of the time! ;) But, I heard from web dev friends, that'll never end.. :D"
2512,Oh never never. Trouble all the time!
2513,Beautiful site @54a81998db8155e6700e553a !
2514,"@54a81998db8155e6700e553a Yes, you can use d3 on there. It’s a great way to get exposure to your visualizations."

2527,"@54a81998db8155e6700e553a Unfortnately, It will probably be tabular and narrative-based (I don’t have data visualization skills). Maybe you could give me some feedback as to how I could make it more intriguing from a presentation perspective?"

2569,maybe I'll even be using the right ' when I say I'll
2570,Morning Kat!
2571,Morning Steven :)
2572,time to go back to coding! Had to take a break for my brain to relax.
2573,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 good morning guys!
2574,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 I hear you. Shouting is a regular feature of my coding sessions (usually upon breakthrough)
2575,good morning @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c Happy Saturday :)
2576,Do you guys think there are security laws against broadcasting your location to the public? I created an android app that lets people broadcast their location to everyone using the same app. I'm just wondering if this breaks any legal laws or something.
2577,Morning @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c This was a crazy week.
2578,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a Tell me about it! What happened on your side of the state?
2579,@548a8c8bdb8155e6700de57a I am pretty sure if the person knows they are doing it. Don't Facebook and Google and many other apps allow location sharing?
2580,Can someone who has a lappy test this: http://codepen.io/iheartkode/full/emzaEm
2581,"@548a8c8bdb8155e6700de57a It’s definitely legal. iPhone has a native app that does this. As long as the person broadcasting their location is aware they’re doing so, it’s fine."
2582,says 100% Mark
2583,"but I""m always plugged in :)"
2584,unplug
2585,"awesome, thanks @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c @547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a"
2586,:)
2587,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 97%
2588,ok unplugged
2589,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 It works!
2590,ty
2591,"Wow, how did you do that?"
2592,DOM api
2593,thats pretty cool
2594,Battery manager api
2595,"```
navigator.getBattery().then(function(battery) {
    $('#level').text(battery.level * 100 + ""%"");
   battery.addEventListener('levelchange', function() {
    $('#level').text(battery.level * 100 + ""%"");
  }); 
});
```"
2596,Nice
2597,"Yea reading the docs and I saw it lol
"
2598,"Sorry guys, I lied... I didnt go back to coding. I went to toast some bagels instead."
2599,Yum
2600,LOL
2601,Kat has it gone down?
2602,I think its in the bylaws that if you lie about coding you have to brink Kat some cronuts
2603,lol
2604,cronuts i see.. lol
2605,MBP it takes ages for me to lose battery
2606,haha
2607,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c The week just flew by.  I am starting a part time PHP job on Monday so I have been trying to get my PHP skill up to speed. Still trying to figure out how to do both PHP and JS and keep it all straight in my head.
2608,and I have all the things open on my desktop :)
2609,jelly
2610,my lappy loses battery in mins
2611,takes ages
2612,heh play some video games your battery will drain
2613,but I also leave it plugged in
2614,lol
2615,I do too.
2616,"I can use my laptop on a cross country flight, and charge my iphone on it to keep it alive and still only get to like 40%"
2617,I'll lose my phone long before I lose the laptop
2618,lol
2619,Why not buy a portable charger o-o?
2620,I get 3 hours on mine
2621,I had one
2622,it got pinched in boston international
2623,"I don't actually fly enough to miss it, I'll eventually get another"
2624,You have a $300 laptop @546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 that's $100 an hour.
2625,lol
2626,What do you guys think is the future of android programming? I started android programming yesterday and I had a lot of fun doing it. I wonder if its a skill worth honing.
2627,You can make Android apps with JS
2628,android isn't going anywhere for awhile
2629,"though I'd lean more to ios, but I'm biased"
2630,Mobil is here to stay
2631,I see
2632,Android is here to stay since google owns it.
2633,"I look at it this way, when was the last time an android phone had users camping out in front of the android store to get their hands on the android on new release :)"
2634,iphones are too simple for me.
2635,people that camp out for a phone need a life
2636,right :)
2637,I totally didn't stay up till three am refreshing a sales page to get my iphone 6plus
2638,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 That's crazy! Apple has created a cult
2639,nope
2640,wasn't me
2641,Android won't be like that because it's open and anyone can create a phone.
2642,Which then introduces issues like ridiculous fragmentation of the OS.
2643,How old is FFC?
2644,When I can afford an iphone and a macbook then I will get into ios. 
2645,Since October 
2646,It's still a baby :o
2647,"I had iphones, too simple, I like to hack my devices."
2648,"i like the iphone, just wish I could afford it."
2649,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 how do you like the 6=Plus? I am worried that a phone that large would be a pain to carry around. Does the usability offset the size?
2650,What does .find() actually do in JQuery
2651,http://api.jquery.com/find/ if you don't mind a lin
2652,"Its really not a pain to carry, not to me anyways, it did take a little getting use to though"
2653,k
2654,finds elements
2655,Yes the api docs is amazing for jquery.
2656,I see. I shall use it
2657,I have them on my tablet as I code :)
2658,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 what kind of tablet do you have?
2659,Some cheap one from China lol
2660,It has linux inside
2661,heh nice
2662,It was 50.00
2663,"A suggestion if you guys use a mac, take a look at this software: http://kapeli.com/dash"
2664,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 You should do a blog post about coding on the cheap.
2665,"Offline documentation for pretty much everything, and it integrates with Alfred and various editors"
2666,lol 
2667,brb
2668,offline hehe
2669," /shrugs, regardless you can search documentation without having to do a browser search"
2670,cool it integrates with sublime
2671,yup
2672,Have you ever used alfred btw?
2673,https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi is pretty cool for the command line.
2674,"I have, I unintalled it"
2675,because of spotlight changes?
2676,"no because it collected dust, I used when I first installed, just not really anything I need"
2677, /nods
2678,The poor programmer  a new blog lol
2679,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 I'd read that :)
2680,lol
2681,If you are a programmer you are definitely not poor.
2682,The poor JavaScript Apprentice lol
2683,Poor programmer in training?
2684,lol yep
2685,Almost done with my challenge x-x
2686,http://codepen.io/iheartkode/pen/dPpoKV  some jquery fun
2687,it works Mark :)
2688,went down without my refreshing it
2689,I like slideDown it's nifty
2690,^ I agree
2691,si
2692,I WILL LEARN HOW TO CREATE THAT SOON!
2693,It's not a lot of code..
2694,I know
2695,I don't don't remember how to put it all together yet.
2696,Anything you want to fadeIn or slideIn needs to be display: none;
2697,"If you want to pair on jQuery let me know,"
2698,hmmm
2699,I need help explaining what this does
2700,"    var discount = $(this).closest(""tour"").data(""dscount"");
    $(this).closest("".tour"").append(message);"
2701,What part of it is getting you caught up?
2702,"you have a spelling error in your data element btw, missing the i in discount"
2703,"ha, thank you"
2704,lol
2705,typos kill code lol
2706,typos are pure evil
2707,yep
2708,that's probably why I didn't understand what was going on
2709,It happens to me daily lol
2710,typos or no ;
2711,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 Thank for pairing with me again!

2715,"or evening, rather!"
2716,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c is on a book review bend this morning :)
2717,"We have many UK coders, just may not be on at the moment."
2718,"Hello all. For challenge 8 (jQuery) is the expectation that we complete the entire Chapter 1 of the ""try jQuery"" site?  This isn't clear because challenge 8 says it should take 30 minutes and am pretty sure Chapter 1 will take longer."
2719,It is the entirety of Chapter 1.
2720,Yes 
2721,Yup
2722,you aren't docked points if it takes you longer than 30 mins :)
2723,"Great, thanks much!"
2724,@5498c6a6db8155e6700e2349 my pleasure
2725,When we finish all the 100 hours of challenges. How do we join non-profit projects?
2726,You follow the instructions on the final challenge.
2727,"@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 let @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c know, it gives you instructions when you click the last banner"

2729,"Oh okay, just wondering. Thank you :D"
2730,http://codepen.io/iheartkode/pen/gbMZEx  Kat you likes gradients?
2731,I do
2732,I love em
2733,"With regards to the non-profit projects, are they projects that can be worked on outside of normal working hours?"
2734,For the best answer:
2735,And is there a minimum amount of commitment expected? I love the idea of it but am unsure how much time I'd be able to commit regularly
2736,team@freecodecamp.com  or @546fda59db8155e6700d6ece  can help if he is around.
2737,"the non profits are for your portfolio and experience, you are in no way obligated to even sign on to any of them"
2738,thank you - as I said I love the idea of it and might perhaps look into it properly when I have some time off
2739,Sounds Great.
2740,"@5480560adb8155e6700db579 Free Code Camp is for busy people, so yes, all these challenges and nonprofit projects intended to be completed over longer stretches of time"
2741,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c thanks Quincy - I wasn't sure if they were projects with deadlines etc. They sound ideal if they can be completed around a busy schedule.
2742,i think there is a bug with gitter that sometimes doesn't allow to click on things or type
2743,Hello World!
2744,Hello @54a83ec4db8155e6700e55f1 welcome to FCC
2745,Welcome @54a83ec4db8155e6700e55f1 !
2746,Hi There @54a83ec4db8155e6700e55f1
2747,How did you find free code camp?
2748,@54a83ec4db8155e6700e55f1 Greetings from San Francisco!
2749,"@5480560adb8155e6700db579 There are a lot of great online courses that have fixed schedules. Gradually, Coursera and EdX are realizing that self-paced courses are superior. The theory behind this is simple: Normally, you want a “cohort” of people who go through the entire process together. But with large volumes of students, you can have “flash cohorts” of people who just happen to be at the same point in the course or curriculum at the same time."
2750,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c I for one am grateful for the self-paced approach :)
2751,how do you guys feel about WordPress?
2752,I am learning it along side programming languages 
2753,Hey everyone!
2754,Hello everyone. Just finished the personal page. ![alt](http://awesomescreenshot.com/05a44k9qbb)
2755,Awesome!
2756,Wordpress  = PHP not a fan
2757,Hello @5489ac6bdb8155e6700de15d
2758,"I agree, not a huge fan of php"
2759,Hey @547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a
2760,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87  I agree, I'm not a fan of PHP, but I did like Wordpress at one point"
2761,Good morning everyone! Happy coding :)
2762,Good morning :)
2763,hey @547bab20db8155e6700d9a93
2764,"Errr afternoon now, ha"
2765,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 :+1: Afternoon
2766,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6  woops you're right!
2767,"i just don't see how i'd ever be able to create a website with all the features wordpress and its plugins offer, and keep them updated, as easily as using wordpress"
2768,"So @5489ac6bdb8155e6700de15d I saw yesterday you’re from NYC, whereabouts? I grew up in Sunset Park."
2769,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 I'm near Central Park East/West
2770,"It's bit confusing, so I just say Central Park is right across the street from my house :laughing: "
2771,Sunset Park as in BK?
2772,"@5489ac6bdb8155e6700de15d Nice. Beautiful area over there. Correct, BK"
2773,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 True city life. It's a shame I haven't been inside the park in years though.
2774,"—_— You’re crazy, I’d be there constantly if I lived next door (dependent on the area of course)"
2775,I used to work at an art gallery a few blocks from the Met. Miss being able to walk into the park on my lunch breaks.
2776,:laughing: It's like the beginning/end depending on how you look at it. Not downtown but the other end of it.
2777,oooooo
2778,Yeah I know where you mean.
2779,Oh yea? That must've been something
2780,"Yeah, I moved art/moved an art library for them over the summer. It was fun work, got to see some amazing art."
2781,"I don't know. I pass by it, or walk around, but never through it. It's sad. But I should, just not like how it used to be you know."
2782,Yeah.
2783,"I love art. Especially the galleries downtown, I've been to a few."
2784,"It makes you want to be friends with photogs, they definitely give you a different perspective of life"
2785,Yeah for sure. 
2786,Le sigh….I miss the city.
2787,I honestly want out :laughing: 
2788,I’ve been away for > 8 years now.
2789,"Been here all my 20 + years, want to see something else."
2790,"""hello world!""."
2791,"Lived in Vermont for 5 years, been here in NC for a long while now too"
2792,NY?
2793,Still not used to being away huh.
2794,hey @54a8469edb8155e6700e5612 Welcome to FCC!
2795,"I am, but I miss it. I miss the train and not having to drive everywhere. I miss the variety of culture and peoples."
2796,Welcome to FCC @54a8469edb8155e6700e5612
2797,"Hi Ben, I had asked a question here the other day and you suggested that I find another chatroom but I forget what it was called. I think it was something like talk tech?"
2798,"Don’t think it was me, but someone else suggested the FreeCodeCamp/Help chatroom for technical questions"
2799,That was it. Thanks! 
2800,"Prices went up here since last you've been. They're raising the fare yet again soon. Plus, they're implementing a Ticket system on the buses. I don't know what for but, I try to stay away from public transit unless absolutely necessary."
2801,Of course :)
2802,I'd rather pay for a cab. :laughing: 
2803,Ick that sounds terrible -_-
2804,"Very much so, I haven't travelled on Bus/Train in a fair amount of months"
2805,What is it up to now per swipe through at the train?
2806,"If I go somewhere it's usually walking distance, or I'll catch a cab."
2807,"Uhh, honestly I'm unsure"
2808,Last I was there it was like 3.00 or 4.50...
2809,"Once 2014 happened, and they raised the fare, they charge us $1 for a metrocard"
2810,Via the subways machine or booth
2811,-_-
2812,It's like $5.50 I think
2813,That’s horrid…..
2814,No more free transfers from a train to train
2815,Each new train ride is a new fare
2816,Unless you transfer within the station
2817,"Oh okay, was going to say O.o if they charged you in station."
2818,They do
2819,"If you're not transferring from one train to the next using stairs to get to another route, or the opposing side, you have to pay again"
2820,Wait so if you took the R in from brooklyn to 14th street and wanted to hop uptown on the N/D they’d charge you again?
2821,"ah I see, just if you’re going from station to station"
2822,"As long as you can catch the train within, like how you mentioned, you can transfer free"
2823,Still you can go train to train easily then without paying more :P
2824,"Yep, so you definitely have to know which stops to get off if you want that ""free transfer"" lmaoo"
2825,and the buses are no free transfers
2826,eh I never took buses anyway
2827,"If you take one heading downtown, you can't take any of the corresponding buses to go back up, only crosstown buses are free transfers"
2828,"I don't like them, but now I don't like either of them."
2829,Pretty obnoxious….heh
2830,hi guys! anybody had an issue with ROBOT's eyes animation?
2831,So if you want to leave NYC where do you want to go instead?
2832,"Yes, and the service hasn't improved"
2833,I want to travel abroad
2834,"Nice, where to?"
2835,I’m hopefully going to either Italy or the Greek Islands in May.
2836,"Not fully decided, but I'd like to see London, Australia, places with cool accents :laughing: "
2837,I know you're going to have fun no matter where you go.
2838,"Oh for certain. The UK was awesome, as was Japan (my previous trips abroad)"
2839,"Change of scenery is always good, helps maintain sanity. That's why I'm trying to work on getting my skills up to par so I can work from anywhere and live a happy relaxing kind of life"
2840,"Lucky you, my last real vacation was over a decade ago."
2841,I'm surprised I'm still sane lmaoo
2842,"Well Japan was through school, UK was…two years ago for christmas and new years."
2843,I think UK was the only real vacation I’ve ever had.
2844,"Awww, that's nice. My only real vacation was to Jamaica. I went twice, 1st time we stood at a hotel (I went in 3rd grade during thanksgiving, stood for 2 weeks), next time when I was 12. We stood at my gma's house."
2845,"hi, I'm just a college student trying to learn how to code since I figured out I'm not as good at physics as I thought I was, but turns out coding is just as interesting!"
2846,Welcome to FCC @54a84a3ddb8155e6700e5626
2847,Welcome @54a84a3ddb8155e6700e5626 :)
2848,welcome to FCC @54a84a3ddb8155e6700e5626 How did you hear about FCC?
2849,"I actually liked physics for the short time I had it, in school. I'm sure you can use your new coding skills and create something that's physics related."
2850,"and I’m off to get lunch, bb in a little while"
2851,Enjoy your lunch
2852,hey @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 how are you?
2853,"Hey @5489ac6bdb8155e6700de15d I'm good, good to see you :) how was your new years?"
2854,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 likewise. I went to sleep early, wasn't really feeling well but it was a nice and peaceful day with my little family"
2855,How was yours?
2856,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 I read an online article (from quartz I believe) where someone basically recommended this site to start learning javascript and all other sorts of things, and so far I like it!"
2857,we rang in the new year snuggled on the sofa like old folks :) 
2858,"@5489ac6bdb8155e6700de15d turns out I like reading about physics and learning physics, just not doing physics, figures"
2859,"Awww, how cute."
2860,I'm really glad you found your way here @54a84a3ddb8155e6700e5626
2861,I was also logged in here helping out new campers :)
2862,"@54a84a3ddb8155e6700e5626 Yea, physics can have it's moments. But that's good though, learning and reading about it only builds your knowledge about it. The figures are challenging for sure."
2863,Oh nice @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 Seems like more and more new comers as the days go by.
2864,"@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c must be proud of his community, it's pulling together nicely."
2865,"Best part, is it's Free."
2866,"OMG I came across something that was similar to FCC but they charged a min fee of $200 a month, can you believe that. Not everyone can afford that especially with most having student loans, and children to support :laughing:"
2867,"Yeah I signed on with FCC because I believe in what we are doing here, I think it should be available to everyone"
2868,I'm also getting involved with a group that teaches code to the poverty stricken as a way to pull themselves out of poverty
2869,"I truly agree. Also, I like how I get to go through the challenges with ease. Before starting this camp, I was all over the place and it wasn't a main focus to what I wanted to learn. Which sometimes can be a challenge for most, figuring out what to start first and maintain their focus on it."
2870,I liked the emphasis on completing projects for non-profits. Most other places will teach you one way or another but they aren't concerned with the career aspect. Whereas with FCC it's a core aspect!
2871,"Oooo, that's amazing @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 How's that going thus far?"
2872,"well I have to learn myself before I can teach, so far I've given money, but eventually I want to actually work with them"
2873,@54a1176bdb8155e6700e39b4 I completely agree with you. And you walk away with more skills to help all types of clients.
2874,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 :+1: that's great, very inspiring as well."
2875,"I intend to focus on the children though, specifically girls, but children in at risk communities"
2876,"public schools have had ot take nearly every extra thing out because of budgets, athletics, music, art and there is very nearly nothing spent on teaching technology as a means to reach up"
2877,"Exactly, and most of the kids are wondering if school was always just about work work work. I feel bad for them, as they won't get to experience the thrill of figuring out what they're skills are and the ability to tap into their creativity unless they take it outside of school, and usually have to pay for it."
2878,it astounds me that so many companies can understand that we aren't teaching tech engineering enough to provide a good work force in this country but do literally nothing about it
2879,anyways I'll tuck my soapbox into the corner for now :)
2880,"But they also need more employees to help their business grow/expand, but I digress. :laughing: "
2881,"I'm working on challenge #30 it's more advanced than I've ever coded before. And I sometimes look back at the code like ""I coded this?"" lmaoo"
2882,"hehe, I know the feeling"
2883,"I'm thinking on how I should host my domains I have. Github seems like a good start, same for Heroku, but I'm still not sure."
2884,I use machighway
2885,"Don't think I want to spend about $50 for the year, not now actually."
2886,FCC uses heroku
2887,Are they prices good? I'm with NameCheap.
2888,"No way, serious?"
2889,Heroku does static via JS right?
2890,we pay $120 a year for 5 sites
2891,I dont know about heroku at all only that FCC is there :)
2892,sorr we get 4 total domains for $120 a year
2893,me and bf personally I mean
2894,That doesn't sound bad.
2895,"I am not a fan actually, and as I start hosting more apps I may have to go with heroku"
2896,"I had trouble just installing WP on machighway, it breaks everything"
2897,"Yes, I'd have to agree."
2898,"Wow, and WP is usually quick to install"
2899,Via cPanel and manually
2900,"yeah machighway doesn't know what to do with it, and we are looking to move off"
2901,"good pricing but they've moved their dc twice since we been with, and as a front end dev I can't work with wp on my own shit? not groovy"
2902,":laughing: They got you very upset. Yep, I don't blame you."
2903,lol
2904,"I've been trying to get bf to move for two years, so yeah :)"
2905,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 I totally get what you're saying about talent, however, the increase in companies outsourcing their training to dev bootcamps is pretty high right now. A friend of mine attended Hackerspace last year and was in a class with 8 facebook employees. Not interns or potentials. Actual employees attending for training."
2906,"2 Years though, why so long?"
2907,"Oh I know companies are investing in their current employees, if you don't you are really not going to make it :)"
2908,Truth.
2909,"I'm specifically talking about investing in the communities you are trying to sell your product to, becoming part of the community rather than milking it dry then moving on seems smarter to me"
2910,but I'm a hippy born out of time :)
2911,"Right, or we'll see this community collapse like the rest of our employment communities."
2912,There's a high demand for devs right now. I'd like it if that could stay that way. 
2913,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 - I agree :)
2914,</soapbox>
2915,This express stuff is fun.
2916,"the thing is, tech moves very fast, I don't see the need for devs easing off any time soon"
2917,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 - invested in the community to add value to it is one of the secrets of selling.
2918,I think I'm gonna build a server for my own personal webpage so my customers can send me a text message straight from the website.
2919,look at twilio
2920,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 - neither do I. Even still with the level of demand, look at the number of members here. The companies who need it far outnumber the talent pool of qualified individuals, and (I believe) the individuals seriously interested and pursuing it."
2921,And have it sync those messages to fogbugz at the same time.
2922,"Twilio is awesome, and pretty cheap for us tightwads."
2923,hello world! I'm an application and indie game developer looking to further my skills in the web development scene.

2925,Welcome to Free Code Camp
2926,Seems like naming your request module request is probably a recipe for disaster. Just sayin...
2927,Hi @54a85269db8155e6700e564a - welcome to FCC
2928,"But, other than that, Express challenge... done."
2929,:thumbsup: 
2930,"Can anyone recommend a hosting service that uses the MEAN stack. I'm currently on HostGator, but it's all PHP and Ruby."
2931,how can I find out?
2932,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3
2933,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3  You can set up the stack on your local and push to Heroku.
2934,"Hey all, can anyone give me a quick hand with a dash tutorial? I don't know if it's my browser or what, but when the robots eye flashes, it goes from two white eyes to one red eye, and back and froth."
2935,The tutorial leaves out info about customizing your background CSS to be two eyes instead of one. You need to edit your background gradient 
2936,@547362dddb8155e6700d7a8c insert `background: 75px 150px;` in all the transition codes
2937,It's a bug in dash. You have to specify the background: 75px 150px in all the transitions.
2938,"Dang, @5498c6a6db8155e6700e2349 beat me."
2939,Thank you kindly!
2940,@549998fcdb8155e6700e264b Find out what?
2941,if my webhost uses MEAN stack @54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3
2942,"@54873b94db8155e6700dd723 Seems like I'm out of touch with today's terminology. Seems like Heroku is set up to run web-apps, but nowhere does it say they host webpages. Is running web-apps the new way to say hosting a website?"
2943,"@549998fcdb8155e6700e264b It would be listed on your webhosts configuration page, or information page. Who do you use?"
2944,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 A webapp is just a website connected to a database. There's the server side code and database. Then there's the website part.
2945,"Hello, World!"
2946,Welcome @54a85c54db8155e6700e5681 !
2947,And I return!

2949,"@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 That's why, for instance, you can created a website that just send request and receives responses from the Twitter API. Twitter is serving the requests to your frontend, but you don't have to maintain any server side code."
2950,"Right, I have a company website that I've already developed that just uses HTML5 and CSS, but I'd like to add some other stuff to it with all this new learning I've been doing. Currently I'm hosting on HostGator, but it won't run Node.JS stuff. Heroku can host the website I have, right? Even without anyone 'app' capabilities of it, right?"

2952,gotta run! leaving work and catching the wildcard games
2953,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 Why do you wish to use Node on a company site out of curiosity? Is it as a project based thing or for a particular reason? Another hosting site to look at is DigitalOcean.
2954,$5 a month for basic hosting
2955,and it’s a VPS so you can do whatever you want with it
2956,^ @54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 What do you want the database to be holding and serving for the website? Gathering people's sign up information?
2957,"I do software consulting. I have project pages on my website with links to a customers Fogbugz, support resources, etc... It would be nice to use Express and Node to dynamically insert Fogbugz support into the webpage, and maybe even use the Twilio API to let them text me problems, etc..."
2958,Take a look at DigitalOcean then.
2959,"Good Afternoon/Good Morning or whatever the case may be wherever you may be
."
2960,ahoy hoy
2961,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 Does Fogbugz have their own API?
2962,"I thought so, http://help.fogcreek.com/8202/xml-api"
2963,"I'm telling you Gitter needs a <time appropriate greeting> where you type in ""Good <tag> everybody"" and the server displays the correct greeting at the receivers end... They didn't add it to the list. :)"

2965,I just start talking. Skips that whole problem entirely lol
2966,Niceties are lost on you??
2967,heh each user's local machine has a the local time? no?

2973,bah
2974,Hey fellow FCCers!
2975,hey
2976,@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 I hear ya. I feel like I am becoming an expert tutorial follower. I can't wait to get to the pair programming and the non profit projects. There is where the training wheels will come off.
2977,Hello @529c6d05ed5ab0b3bf04da90 and @54a58417db8155e6700e4b5f
2978,"@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 Admittedly, I don't know exactly what functionality you're trying to add to your site. I was just curious as to what you need to do that can't be accomplished through jQuery ajax/json requests."
2979,"i feel ya @54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806  im in the same boat as you, im just looking foward to the non profit projects and stuff. then ill really learn"
2980,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a totally agree on being an expert tutorial follower. I've just started reading a book called Made To Stick and it is quite insightful on how to learn effectively and is going to change how I learn and follow tutorials from now on. I'm only 10% in and I can already recommend it.
2981,"@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 Yes, that’s by design. The tutorials aren’t meant to stretch your brain - just to give you a rapid-fire primer. You’ll do tons of open-ended thinking on the projects."
2982,Sorry the title is actually Make It Stick *
2983,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a I agree. I tweeted a one-sentence book review earlier today:
2984,https://twitter.com/ossia/status/551441712011157504
2985,yeah i get confused between made to stick and make it stick because they have such similar titles but I have them both on my kindle. Haven't read made o stick yet. 
2986,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c @54a1176bdb8155e6700e39b4 I'll check out that book. Thanks!
2987,How does that book change the way you approach learning?
2988,"previously I would follow instructions and get really into a topic and learn by repetition and surrounding myself with that topic to ""burn"" it into my memory. "
2989,in the book they say this is actually not that effective 
2990,so the traditional way that a book is organised with one chapter for one topic and then the next chapter on another topic goes against how we learn
2991,"instead they recommend interleaved learning, tackling multiple different topics and having them interspersed. Also always trying to link what you learn with what you already know. as well say when you finish a tutorial, rather than moving onto the next one, test yourself on the knowledge you just learned, ask yourself questions about it, imagine explaining it to someone else etc."
2992,those are the main things ive picked up so far. 
2993,Wow thanks thats really helpful!
2994,currently working through the Learn jQuery CodeSchool section and this question was definitely coming to mind for me.
2995,Am I learning how to create my own solutions or just learning how their solutions work?
2996,Although of course at this early stage I'm probably getting a bit ahead of myself :)
2997,Never to early! ;)
2998,So as I try to scalp the tl;dr version of the book from you :P
2999,The idea is to self-question and review as you go through a tutorial rather than simply filling in answers and moving on?
3000,"I guess the problem is that you want to move through the material quickly and spending a lot of time reviewing seems like it takes twice as long. I guess if the point is actually learning the material rather than completing the tutorials it's worth the extra time.

The other problem is that a lot of material ""is organised with one chapter for one topic and then the next chapter on another topic""..."
3001,And the way to combat that would be more review while tying in other learned material I imagine
3002,"Another thing I noticed about completing online tutorials. I get kind of hooked on the sense of completion. If I'm moving quickly through a course I feel I'm crushing it etc.. But there is no point in completing something if you don't absorb it. An example is the complete web dev course. I'm at the end of the Jquery section completing the code player task. At the outset of the video Rob says to have a go at the project on your own before watching the video. I had a go got half way through just styling it and got really stuck. I think old me would have watched the video, felt I actually did know a lot of what he does and then move on excited to get stuck into the Bootstrap section. But now I'm going to see how he does it and then attempt it again without watching his video. And keep doing it until I can do the whole thing on my own without referring to his video at all. Otherwise whats the point? "
3003,@548f117ddb8155e6700df665 yep. Can you synthesize what you learned? Put it in your own words? Link it to your current knowledge base? Use it in your own project?
3004,"In other words, make sure you dont rely on the material so much that its just a crutch and allow yourself to struggle"
3005,sort of the opposite of what I've been doing with the jQuery exercises :P
3006,"Yep. Bingo. According to the authors, easy learning = here today, gone tomorrow. when your struggling is when its sticking"
3007,kind of like lifting weights. the last rep in a set is the one that counts.
3008,Cool. Looks like I'll be going back through dem tuts!
3009,">Another thing I noticed about completing online tutorials. I get kind of hooked on the sense of completion. If I'm moving quickly through a course I feel I'm crushing it etc.. 

I fall into this trap. For example I want to complete the Treehouse tracks. I do  work through and type everything out. I guess I should spend more time on the extra credit steps.

My problem is and remains to be not being able to stick to one thing long enough to master it. I started with Python, moved to PHP, then to JavaScript, and now back to PHP. "
3010,"That is why this FCC format is really helping me honestly...having a track laid out for me to follow kind of allows me to banish a bit of the ""ooh shiny!"" temptation."
3011,I think what has helped me enormously is making something of my own with the knowledge I've gained
3012,Went through an API learning sprint and came out with this
3013,https://github.com/Swelly/Versery
3014,which helped me immensely in terms of holding onto the material I just covered
3015,Well I am hoping to do both the FCC and the PHP work. I just need to focus on PHP for now since they are going to pay me to learn.
3016,Project based learning also builds your portfolio
3017,"Do you have a site running Versery?

3064,Do any of you use [spritz?](http://www.spritzinc.com/) 
3065,Hello world! I found freeCodeCamp in a Google search for online boot camps. I'm a developer looking to sharpen my skillset
3066,Never heard of spritz @547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a
3067,Welcome @54a8880ddb8155e6700e572d !
3068,Check it out. It lets you read really quickly. I like it because it makes it easier to stay focused while reading.
3069,Hello @54a8880ddb8155e6700e572d
3070,Actually my problem is I need to slow down my reading...
3071,It wouldn’t be good for me to speed it up any further...
3072,heh you could pick a slower speed. :)
3073,haha
3074,http://iruntheinternet.com/05680 bahaha
3075,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a it was amazing the faster speeds got easier to read... i maxed out at 350
3076,thanks for sharing that
3077,"nice app @547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a , tried it now at 1000 WPM, almost passed out. haha"
3078,It’s entirely counter to the way I read. Interesting. I look at a page and read the whole thing at once. I don’t read word by word.
3079,I don't feel confident with traversing the DOM. Should I redo the challenges if I don't feel comfortable?
3080,"@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 Go at the pace you feel comfortable with. If you think you should go through the challenges again then that’s fine, nothing wrong with it. Also you could look up other DOM traversing resources and see if they help fill in the blanks"
3081,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 I wish I could read like that.
3082,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a It’s great for pleasure reading but sometimes details can be missed if you’re reading something like a textbook or a scientific journal article. I have to re-read those sometimes.
3083,"@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 Something like photographic memory or? Have you read any ""Speed reading"" books ?"
3084,"@54a0ace5db8155e6700e38bf Neither actually. When I was younger I just taught myself to read this way because I absolutely hated reading. So I looked for ways to expedite the process. So instead of reading word by word, or line by line, I’ll look at the page and sorta read it all at the same time, then move on to the next page."
3085,it’s weird/hard to explain
3086,Good evening everyone! I just finished my year end summary blog post
3087,http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/01/2014-in-numbers-my-life-behind-the-command-line.html

3095,"Every time somebody types ""shoes"" a bell rings."
3096,LOL
3097,I think its in my dna

3107,Finishing codeschool challenges. Just got done getting full MEAN stack up and running on my machine while I was on break from studying.
3108,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 How did you set up your MEAN stack?
3109,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a Followed this; https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-a-mean-js-stack-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-server for my Ubuntu laptop. Used this one; https://hackhands.com/how-to-get-started-on-the-mean-stack/ for the Windows 7 laptop and desktop.
3110,<3 digital ocean
3111,The ubuntu was a pain. 
3112,The windows used all NextNextNext installers.
3113,haha
3114,Awesome post @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c
3115,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 :+1:  Thanks! Digital Ocean is neat!
3116,do i need to learn PHP?
3117,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c I impressed about the data you collect regarding your daily activities. Wishing you the best during 2015.
3118,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a I'm thinking I'm liking it. Probably going to switch webhost services to them.
3119,@54a59d6edb8155e6700e4bba No. Welcome to the awesomeness of the MEAN stack. Full-Stack Javascript developers unite.

3128,Greetings Fellow Coders!
3129,Hello!
3130,What is everyone up to?
3131,Just relaxing.. You?
3132,and drinking some wine :)
3133,Going through Stanfords CS101 course. How about you?
3134,hey Mark
3135,GitHub sign-in removed from FreeCodeCamp?
3136,How do I access my account?
3137,hello world!
3138,"I've worked through a few challenges today.  Getting ready to start the Stanford CS101 course, but @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c's post about his year got me sidetracked into investigating ways to track my time this year.  :)"
3139,@549dfc66db8155e6700e328a You can log in with any of the other options
3140,It doesn't work
3141,I made an account with FCC in December by signing up through GitHub
3142,since then I have been accessing my account by signing in through GitHub. That option seems to have been removed now. I have tried accessing my account through Twitter but it just creates a new account rather than accessing the existing one.
3143,what do you mean it doesn't work?
3144,oh
3145,that is intersting
3146,are you sure it's a new account? We did update the challenges recently and all progress was lost
3147,Hello World! 
3148,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 forgot to reply xD, i got side tracked. I was looking at BuzzFeed"
3149,@54a8ad09db8155e6700e57ac Welcome to FCC! :) We're glad to have you
3150,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8  thank you!
3151,"I found this through a link on my friend's tumblr, and I want to learn code because it seems useful"
3152,"Well, FCC homepage used to have 4 ways of signing up: github, twitter, facebook and google. Now it only has 3."
3153,For me it is a problem because I signed up using Github thus I can only access my account using Github.
3154,P.S. Worked out a solution
3155,I understand. They are all linked. So it shouldn't matter which one you signed up with
3156,"Well, it seems they are not linked. At least in my case."
3157,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 @546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 Have you heard anyone else having those issues ^
3158,My GitHub account is only linked to my hotmail account so for example signing up with my Google account would not grant me access to my account.
3159,gotcha
3160,that makes sense then that it wouldn't work for you
3161,"The github signup was glitching, I believe it's being worked on asap."
3162,I noticed a pattern in the authentication urls used by FCC: http://www.freecodecamp.com/auth/[service]
3163,"so I just insert ""github"" in [service] and I am in!"
3164,*inserted
3165,That shouldn't work
3166,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87  that is a bug
3167,I was scared I had lost my progress and my forum posts! :D
3168,how many FCC challenges are there currently?  Is 53 correct?
3169,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 Cool! @546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 Do you mean that inserting github http://www.freecodecamp.com/auth/[service] should not work? So I just found my first bug in a website! :D
3170,There are 54 challenges I think @54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72
3171,"I have a question about this code
$("".photo"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function(){});
when I type"". photo"" it selects the .photos class in the ul element. Then inside the event handler of .on() is it just selecting all of the li nested in the class "".photo"" ?"
3172,Starting from 0 :)
3173,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 54 is correct
3174,"ah ok great for some reason i thought i was missing some...i think i got a bug, because 3 of my show as completed that I didnt do"
3175,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48751994/code.png
3176,"@549dfc66db8155e6700e328a Yes, it was removed because it was being buggy, but being able to access it like that should not work because we dont want people to log in with github at the moment"
3177,I wonder if it's related to the log in problem?
3178,"'''
$("".photo"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function(){});
'''"
3179,oops
3180,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 Your challenges being marked off is related to removing 6 of the challenges
3181,a known bug
3182,"` ` `
$("".photo"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function(){});
` ` `
Sorry guys, I'm just testing this out."
3183,Why isn't it working o-o
3184,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 I see. So how should I log in?
3185,@sircharleswatson ahh ok thanks that explains it
3186,three back ticks :)
3187,My dog had backticks. We had to take him to the vet.
3188,lol
3189,"```
$("".photo"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function(){});
```"
3190,"I got it!
"
3191,Yay
3192,anyone have experience with google maps api?
3193,so what did you want to do when they enter the photo
3194,"@549dfc66db8155e6700e328a That is a good question. I assume that the majority of people use the same email for each service so it normally wouldn't be a problem. For your situation however, i'm not sure."
3195,"for .on(""li"") is this written to select the li?"
3196,@549dfc66db8155e6700e328a I personally would just log in with another service and mark the challenges i've already done
3197,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 might have a better idea
3198,You want the li to be selected or the class photo?
3199,Let's add a bit more behavior to the page though. Write an event handler that watches for mouseenter on any li elements within our .photos elements and runs an empty function. We'll implement the function later on.
3200,It's telling me to do this
3201,Let's add a bit more behavior to the page though. Write an event handler that watches for mouseenter on any li elements within our .photos elements and runs an empty function. We'll implement the function later on.
3202,@546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 Ok.
3203,"```
$("".photo"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function(){
 
});
```"
3204,"No I didn't realize we had taken the github login off, though I am glad we did till its working properly, I too would just log in with something else and mark them off"
3205,"I see nothing wrong with this event handler
"
3206,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 I think I see it instead of typing li in the event handler. Can I type it like this
```
$("".photo li"").on(""mousenter"", function(){
});
```"
3207,yes
3208,So why is it that people choose to write the descendant into the event handler?
3209,that is correct but I think they want the li inside the even handler but you can try
3210,it listens for it
3211,on mousenter
3212,yea it's kinda odd
3213,"Hmmm, it's something I just have to get used to"
3214,fcc site down for bug fix?
3215,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c FCC is down
3216,Apparently
3217,Yep
3218,I just ordered some stickers JS and Xubuntu :)
3219,from what website
3220,https://www.unixstickers.com/
3221,I ordered Tux and ruby stickers before they are good quality.
3222,I like their stickers :D
3223,Anybody else having problems with the site?
3224,Yes it's down at the moment.
3225,Okay cool.

3237,"Free is great. But sometimes, I get side-tracked so easily."
3238,Thats easy in the programming world
3239,Takes discipline 
3240,Really does. We're surrounded by many things. So it's difficult to focus sometimes./
3241,Lots of tools to distract us lol

3334,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 Don't worry about it lol

3337,lol
3338,"Okay,I wont look into it then xD"
3339,:P
3340,Just another distraction.
3341,yeah until you learn JS any of the frameworks are going to slow you down and you may not understand why they do what they do
3342,"hmmm, thanks :D"
3343,Ill just ask some other time lol
3344,Vanilla JS    first then frameworks :)
3345,codewars as an alternate resource

3368,Question. Why does FCC introduce jQuery before the basics of JS?
3369,they’re free
3370,google paid for you
3371,"Little angular won't hurt, I like to bounce around and understand things lol"
3372,"also hi everyone, apparently I'm supposed to say hey (or ""hello world!"") and that I found you on r/frontend"
3373,Because jQuery gives you instant satisfaction and you use it a lot.
3374,Hello and welcome :)
3375,"@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 because jquery is actually a really easy js framework that doesn’t really require a lot of knowledge of the intracacies of js, and reinforces the dom in your mind, which you’ve just finished brushing up on from html and css"
3376,@54a8ba9bdb8155e6700e57e2 welcome
3377,"I see, Thanks again"
3378,@54a8ba9bdb8155e6700e57e2 Welcome!

3381,@54a8ba9bdb8155e6700e57e2  Glad to have you :)
3382,Did anyone here go to Hack Reactor?
3383,do software trends vary between countries?
3384,is the forum running ember discuss?
3385,It's Discourse
3386,that's what I meant haha
3387,lol
3388,I figured lol
3389,Some people have been to hack reactor.
3390,ok caught up :)
3391,Really?  That's my end goal with doing FCC.
3392,hey Guys 
3393,How has applied to hack reactor?
3394,er programming languages i mean....are certain languages more popular in different places?
3395,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 I kan haz grammer
3396,My goal is to apply to Fullstack Academy
3397,haz
3398,Why Fullstack?
3399,@tesla809 save your money
3400,I’d prefer to learn from free resources and get the same paying job as someone who spends thousands on a code bootcamp
3401,^
3402,If I spend any money. It would be for online courses if anything.
3403,^^
3404,"well, higher pay ideally"
3405,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 online courses in what?
3406,"math, cs, design?"
3407,"Since FCC is new, has there been a few that have received offers?"

3411,@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478  cs or design
3412,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 I’d suggest looking at edx
3413,coursera is another good one
3414,Front end masters if you don’t mind paying a bit per month
3415,"plenty of free courses that aren’t dumbed down for the masses, offered by schools like stanford, mit, harvard, and others"
3416,coursera is good too
3417,GreatCodeClub is good too.  They actually use the same discourse platform.

3422,Anyone try out the Udacity Nanodegrees?
3423,http://www.appapress.com/
3424,A site in 2015 is using one.
3425,LOL
3426,And FCC has a live weekly pair programming show
3427,I am shocked.
3428,>High Quality Standards...
3429,lmao
3430,"joining late, Good day all "
3431,they haven't updated the footer since 2013 apparently
3432,lol
3433,What do you guys think of this website for courses. skilledup.com
3434,is it free?
3435,I can't has screenhero on WIN XP? So sad.. 
3436,seems that way
3437,They offer some for free
3438,You have Win xp?
3439,What's Win XP?
3440,I thought my laptop was old
3441,Man WIN xp is still around. Man you are holding on. lol
3442,Yes I am.. I like it.
3443,winxp is a windows version that is no longer supported :)
3444,Nope
3445,"Haha, I know.."
3446,Greatcodeclub is $30 a month!!! For what?
3447,Just mentioning the elephant in the room.
3448,"30$ for learning code from who? ""Great Code Club"""
3449,There's a lot of solid projects on there.  I've been a member for awhile.
3450,Well then.. I am off to get source code of Screen Hero to rewrite it to support Win Xp .. not. 
3451,@54a0ace5db8155e6700e38bf if I was writing desktop software I wouldn’t support xp either
3452,lol
3453,anyone applying to full stack academy?
3454,sup guys
3455,Actually made some good friends through there who work here in the city (i.e. Hired.com).
3456,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 remembers windows beta
3457,lol yes I do 
3458,I remember upgrading to windows 95!
3459,So much hate for winxp.. I like getting my hands dirty everytime I format and find drivers manually heh..
3460,Actually no I don't 
3461,Throwback Win 3.1x
3462,"it fit on 4 double sided 5.5"" floppies :)"
3463,But why would you pay someone money to work on a project?
3464,I remember thinking that Win 98 was awesome
3465,+ DOS
3466,I actually think xp was the best windows version so far
3467,I use DOSbox to play old games
3468,its just no longer supported :)
3469,I have Windows 95 on disk
3470,"on a custom built computer that had a 28.8 kbps modem… and then I upgraded that puppy to a 56K, man did that seem fast"
3471,I likely have a copy of 95 and 98 tucked away somewhere too

3473,XP was the best since it was the first multitasking OS.
3474,"I think XP was the longest version they had out. then came ""vista"""

3476,Windows ME lol
3477,I remember my girlfriend had Win ME. 
3478,Ill
3479,I hated ME
3480,I had ME it was Sh*T

3485,yes
3486,Vista is like me junk.

3493,Win 7 / Xubuntu
3494,"I'm on a mac, I just blew out my windows partition, it was eating space"

3525,"For the codebyte challenges, is it required to do them through pair programming?"
3526,and you have the amazing .deb Debian Package Manager :)

3531,"@54a05a8adb8155e6700e37a2 Sorry no one was available to pair with you using Team Viewer. No, you don’t need pair program on the Coderbyte challenges, but it makes them a lot more fun."

3533,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c might have been a failure on heroku’s part
3534,So... I'm just going to say it. What is Debian?
3535,a linux distro
3536,@codeshi At least one of our users has received a raise using the skills he learned here.
3537,"Ubuntu made debian friendlier.  I have been promoting Ubuntu since release.. back when they had Edubuntu  an education release of ubuntu that had math, spelling and all sorts of games for kids to learn..

3547,@54a8c2dbdb8155e6700e5803 Welcome to our community
3548,yes Linux is an OS :) here let me introduce you http://www.linux.com/
3549,@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 you should do a LFS build on your dev box
3550,hi there @54a8c2dbdb8155e6700e5803 welcome :)
3551,streamline that puppy and make it MEAN
3552,I use Xubuntu which is Ubuntu with Xfce which is a desktop manager :)
3553,why so you don't have to do it? LOL
3554,got it. So then Debian is just a version of linux like Win 7 is a version of Windows?
3555,I’ve done it on top of xubuntu for the fcc release
3556,man you all would never see me :)
3557,awesome!
3558,"Yep, a distribution of linux."
3559,"Thanks @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c for the street cred shout outs, I don't doubt that FCC is awesome and effective, I'm just kind of a metrics-kind-of-guy."
3560,it’s actually just a clone of a configured vm :P
3561,So far Fedora has been working pretty well. 
3562,but I’m goign to redo it and use vmdk for the format so it doens’t tie anyone to virtual box exclusively
3563,I need help
3564,It's been many many many years to get Linux ready for the average user..
3565,"@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 that’s why we’re here, shoot"
3566,as far as I understand it all the (K/X/L)Ubuntu are all semi official Ubuntu so I just clump them under generally Ubuntu - you can always just install the different window manager if you pick vanilla Ubuntu anyway
3567,what's up @54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9?
3568,Interesting. 
3569,I will paste it
3570,Or can I just link to the challenge
3571,http://try.jquery.com/levels/4/challenges/11
3572,ok and what problem are you having?
3573,So i created function showPhotos(){};
3574,is that the correct way?
3575,that URL won't show us the work you've done
3576,can you paste the code?
3577,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 what have you tried?
3578,uhm let me paste xD
3579,"```
var showPhotos function() {
}
```"
3580,This is what I see from your url 
3581,"$(document).ready(function() {
  $(""#tour"").on(""click"", ""button"", function() {
    $("".photos"").slideToggle();
  });
  $("".photos"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function() {
    $(this).find(""span"").slideToggle();
  }).on(""mouseleave"", ""li"", function() {
    $(this).find(""span"").slideToggle();
  });
});
"
3582,is there an equal sign some where in there
3583,"```
$(document).ready(function() {
$(""#tour"").on(""click"", ""button"", function() {
$("".photos"").slideToggle();
});
$("".photos"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function() {
$(this).find(""span"").slideToggle();
}).on(""mouseleave"", ""li"", function() {
$(this).find(""span"").slideToggle();
});
});


```"
3584,"```
$(document).ready(function() {
  $(""#tour"").on(""click"", ""button"", function() {
    $("".photos"").slideToggle();
  });
  $("".photos"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function() {
    $(this).find(""span"").slideToggle();
  }).on(""mouseleave"", ""li"", function() {
    $(this).find(""span"").slideToggle();
  });
  function showPhotos(){	
  }
});

```"
3585,much better... I better learn the markup here 
3586,https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48751994/code.png
3587,"i wrote the function incorrect?
"
3588,"yes, functions are either `function name(params) or var name = function(params)`"
3589,It looks like both our event handler on .photos li elements are exactly the same! Let's go ahead and refactor these into a new function named showPhotos and change our event handlers to reference that instead.
3590,you need to put
3591,"$(this).find(""span"").slideToggle();"
3592,into the function
3593,that's all?
3594,then change the event handlers instead of calling a whole function to call showPhotos
3595,and reference your function in the event
3596,ahhh! Thank you!
3597,You have a few types of functions..
3598,instead of
3599,"$("".photos"").on(""mouseenter"", ""li"", function() {
    $(this).find(""span"").slideToggle();"
3600,well there’s also anonymous functions
3601,"put $("".photos"").on(""mousenter"",""li"",showPhotos)"
3602,Ohh thank you guys. I didn't want to click the hint because It wouldn't make me understand just by looking at it
3603,We have a room: https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Help  to get help without a busy chat.
3604,bed time for me. talk to ya'll later
3605,take care @546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8
3606,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 Thanks, didn't see that"
3607,Cya
3608,"@5471b82adb8155e6700d7478 the first JS stuff I learned used anonymous functions almost exclusively, it was so frustrating and I didn't understand anything by the end of it :)"
3609,whats the syntax to display code properly in this chat btw? Not that familiar with git styling
3610,"anonymous functions are awesome, but for this particular exercise they wouldn’t work since they want you to reference the function from the handler"
3611,@54a4b680db8155e6700e491e you’ll use anonymous functions a whole lot more going forward :)
3612,especially when you start node
3613,and because you've called 2 anon functions that are identical it's better to declare one function and then recall it
3614,@54a77922db8155e6700e531d use the ` three times
3615,@54a4b680db8155e6700e491e thanks
3616,"like this:
```
code = codeIsFun;
```
"
3617,@54a77922db8155e6700e531d no problem!
3618,"what suggestions are there for tackling the coderbyte challenges?  I've done about half of the easy, but struggling through alot."
3619,you might try pairing with someone
3620,https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/LetsPair though its an exercise in patience :)
3621,ah neat i didnt know there was a chat room thanks
3622,"but other than pairing, any suggestions out there?  ive been reading eloquentJS a little"
3623,read more and practice
3624,"Code a lot.
"
3625,"and look at other people’s solutions and learn what you can, though realize the shortest solution isn’t necessarily the best solution"
3626,I would do more reading and trial an error 
3627,i wonder if it helps to study completed algorightms
3628,"if you study the right ones, sure"
3629,if there is a good resource for solved challenges
3630,And read the JS style guide.
3631,otherwise it can hurt if they used a really poor solution that runs in like n! or n^2 time
3632,"@54a4cf6edb8155e6700e4961 wouldn't call Debian/Ubuntu (and other distributions of Linux) a 'version of linux' like Windows 7 is a 'version of Windows', it doesn't quite work like that. GNU/Linux is an operating system by itself, but it's about as much of a blank slate of an operating system as you can get. So there exist distributions of Linux. They take that blank slate and add things people will probably find useful. Each of them have different opinions about how things should be done, which software should come preinstalled, which software to make available through their official package manager on their official repository (which will involve making decisions about which type of software (eg. open source, binary blobs) they want to support). Each of these is put together by different people, so it's not like a different version of Windows, which will still be put together by Microsoft. However software is likely to work across distributions. (also a package manager is a software installation tool - a repository is a bucket/list of softwares)"
3633,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 do you have link for style guide by chance?
3634,Yes
3635,https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml
3636,The google one :)
3637,i think i saw on reddit a list of common interview algorithm questions with answers....but im not sure it was in javascript
3638,"@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 it’s kind of a pain in the beginning, but setting up node locally and using an editor that has linting can enforce some pretty good styling"
3639,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 tyty
3640,np :)
3641,i write in codepen that uses lint i think
3642,Brackets has linting for JS CSS and HTML
3643,i also have brackets...do people use that for JS?
3644,I do.
3645,as do I
3646,You can install the JsHint plugin
3647,"Oh, for folks who are a bit further along with development and who are looking for a really good full featured IDE, I highly highly recommend: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ "
3648,ok cool i should try it more
3649,It’s pretty awesome. 
3650,(and free if you’re a student!)
3651,"Webstorm is great, but free is the only case for some."
3652,@54a8ba9bdb8155e6700e57e2 thanks for the detailed description
3653,Also free for OS work
3654,Like what we do here...
3655,i should look to see what kind of tools are available through uni here in sweden
3656,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 you may be able to get the student pack from github
3657,ah ok....(i feel lost on github)
3658,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 learn to love it
3659,actually one question i have about github...
3660,if someone has a repo there....can you not always see a live demo of it?
3661,only if they’ve set it up
3662,and it’s public
3663,ah ok that makes sense
3664,"@54a4cf6edb8155e6700e4961 in case you have any questions relating to that - or something else  - feel free to ask me, I'll try to help where I can."
3665,is a demo usually set up on pages.github project pages?
3666,or can it be demo'd some other way?  like codepen does
3667,you can demo it however you like
3668,pages require you to know git
3669,and then link to it from your repo
3670,ok cool ...im sure it will make sense when get in there more
3671,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 @5498c6a6db8155e6700e2349 could you quickly describe the exact bug on Dash? I’ll tweet it to the creator.
3672,"Hi all, a new guy here..."
3673,hello world!

3675,Hello @54a8ca15db8155e6700e5823  welcome!
3676,idk if I should pay to host my portfolio now or just wait.
3677,@54a8ba9bdb8155e6700e57e2 If I have any more I'll definitely ask
3678,"@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 you can use github pages. generally you'll have a special branch that hosts just the demo page. it's called 'gh-pages'. quite often it's used as a place where some simple documentation or a  'getting started' information page is held. quick real life example: https://github.com/gcuisinier/jenv is the main repository, but has a special branch 'gh-pages' https://github.com/gcuisinier/jenv/tree/gh-pages which is hosted on github (but has it's own domain): http://www.jenv.be/
it's fairly simple to set up, and it's well documented by GitHub. This is only really relevant for static websites, however."
3679,thanks!
3680,5.00 at digital ocean is what I use for my site.

3682,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 depends what your portfolio consists of. Just static? You might be able to get away with just github pages. or AWS S3 for a bit more control and ability to enable SSL.
3683,"It's static right now, I will be adding javascript soon"
3684,I used github pages for a long time.. and you can point your domain to it.
3685,JS is fine as long as it's on the client.
3686,"I see, I'll just use github"
3687,You will learn some git in the process.
3688,thank you guys :D
3689,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 yes like @546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 it would still be static. dynamic would mean that it's running on server - has something being calculated and not just being just served
3690,Anytime
3691,I mean like @546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 said*
3692,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 is not static
3693,or an it..
3694,lol
3695,I changed it lol
3696,btw if you hit the up arrow key you can edit your last message :)
3697,"@pedromaltez thanks for examples!  i did follow githubs instructions to set up a project page, but it didnt work for me.  But then i soon figured out i could preview with brackets and codepen.  So stopped trying to troubleshoot on GH pages "
3698,I was wondering if anyone could elaborate on the differences between learning from this website and self-training myself to learn Python. Let me know please!
3699,yeah I hadn't realised you could edit messages on this chatroom software - used to IRC and the like
3700,thanks @546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87
3701,
3702,This website is focused on JavaScript.
3703,But there are a lot of resources on the web for Python..
3704,JavaScript is more front end coding to create web pages correct? While Python is a higher level program that would be more useful creating video games or controlling computers?
3705,So there is no comparison.
3706,"Right, also Math and Science."
3707,Thanks!
3708,also if you learn javascript you can probably teach yourself python more easily later - unless you've decided you're going to learn python and that's it.
3709,"JS is also for server side, desktop and pc controllers."
3710,"Python is also applicable to Web development via Django, Flask, etc"
3711,Well... there are plenty of games built in JavaScript
3712,And Games HTML5 :)
3713,also mobile games 
3714,"Would anybody advice against learning from a 1600 page Python book, and to just start this website?"
3715,What is your goal?
3716,@benstoltz I hear you do GIS?  do you know and use python also?  
3717,"I would like to one day be a software engineer, possibly at Google. Or run a business dealing with computer science and technology support"
3718,@54a8c2dbdb8155e6700e5803 which book?
3719,I would always advise someone to not learn from a 1600 page book because that sounds like hell. unless you're the kind of person that enjoys 1600 page books.
3720,"Python is good for that, as MIT adopted it.."
3721,'Learning Python' by Mark Lutz - 5th edition
3722,lol what pedro says
3723,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 Affirmative on both counts.
3724,Learn Python the Hard Way is another great resource for learning Python
3725,"yes @54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6, about to suggest LPtHW"
3726,Books like that are dry and will get boring fast lol
3727,finished rewriting javascripts native methods for arrays and strings
3728,i was considering applying for masters in GIS
3729,took me two days
3730,I say learn python the hard way and code your heart out.
3731,so happy right now :)
3732,@54a1cb32db8155e6700e3c72 Where at?
3733,Lund Uni in sweden
3734,Entirely unfamiliar with :P
3735,What was your undergrad in?
3736,python the hard way: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/
3737,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 would you say there are advantages to learning it the hard way? Just simply problem solving and more fault that would allow more in depth learning?
3738,its actually a fully online course.....(I don't know how internationally reputable it is)
3739,Because when you struggle you learn.
3740,brb
3741,well Lund Uni is full on reputable...I just dont know the rep of the GIS master program
3742,aye
3743,"What was your undergrad degree in, if you don’t mind my asking?"
3744,Bio/Zoo/Ecology
3745,"Oh nice, I originally went to college for Enviro scie"
3746,Specifically was looking at marine science/salt marshes
3747,the GIS program is enviro focused
3748,Which browser do you guys prefer?  FFox or Chrome?
3749,"btw does gitter tell you when someone mentioned you and you missed it? so far it's only said ""# new/unread messages"" when I return to the page."
3750,I use both
3751,i finished the intro GIS course before christmas...i really liked it
3752,Safari
3753,Opera
3754,IE
3755,Another very good online GIS masters is at Penn State (I don’t know how it works for international students): http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/geographic-information-systems-gis-masters/overview
3756,Chrome all the way
3757,@54a8ba9bdb8155e6700e57e2 the one that runs the code.
3758,haha exactly! :D
3759,ah i saw Penn's GIS MOOC
3760,i think
3761,"They have an exceptional program, my GF is going there for her Masters/Phd"
3762,ah nice!
3763,"One thing I’ll definitely say, getting web dev/programming experience is going to put you massssssssively ahead in the GIS field."
3764,Chrome
3765,i saw an earlier person with her website on data viz....that was really cool
3766,Aye
3767,do you use QGIS?
3768,"actually I prefer Chrome generally, but I wish it performed like Safari. I don't know what voodoo Apple performed,, but at least on a 'retina' display it is much much smoother. However there's one incredibly frustrating bug in Chrome for OS X that has been around for too long - it handles something in Facebook wrong and pisses me off all the time by scrolling back up to the top of the page every time I exit a modal"
3769,I mean more from a marketability standpoint and from an increased starting salary standpoint. Programming compentency makes you significantly more valuable
3770,"I mainly use an ESRI stack, though I’ve used QGIS and GRASS before, Leaflet, Mapbox, etc"
3771,my partner is a GIS professional...i keep trying to get him to play around with the python codeacadmey course
3772,What type of GIS does he do?
3773,Python is the language for science.
3774,"Nasa uses it :)
"
3775,he's mostly worked for local government
3776, /ndos
3777,nods*
3778,a lot of property mapping
3779,utilities
3780,Python scripting becomes incredibly useful when working in a GIS environment. Highly highly highly recommend it.
3781,Woooooo script automation….>.> <.<
3782,woooooo!
3783,I have a fat ruby and a rails sticker on my laptop I wonder if it will come off lol
3784,i try to tell him that codeacademy is fun!

3816,right?! I'm excited to start learning crypto 
3817,wow fun and sounds like great experience.  i'm super paranoid about security...would be nice to know more about it before building sites

3866,"Hey everyone, I just finished editing my blog post. (If you read it earlier, I accidentally omitted about half of it). Here it is if you have 5 minutes and want to read about my quantified self efforts: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/01/2014-in-numbers-my-life-behind-the-command-line.html"
3867,Oh goodie! :-) Thanks. 
3868,@54a8e651db8155e6700e5871 tell us a little about yourself and your relationship with technology
3869,"@QuincyLarson OMG, book reviews even! You've inspired me to track 2015 so I can post my own year-in-review in early 2016."
3870,how important is a consistent sleep schedule?
3871,I'm currently reading your blog post. @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c
3872,"@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 Gosh, if it's super important I'm in trouble. I sleep when my body wants, regardless of what the timeclock says. Been doing so for over 1.5 years. I cured the HORRIBLE insomnia I suffered from for over 4 years."
3873,@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 it helps your body adapt to whatever sleep schedule you want. You have to plan it out
3874,I also use SleepCycle app. Best app I've ever purchased.
3875,"For me, trying to fit my sleep into an artificial schedule just didn't work. "
3876,@548cf43edb8155e6700dee42 I looked into polyphasic sleep to maximize my productivity throughout the day.
3877,well I guess my sleep schedule is consistent. I just don't sleep at night
3878,"@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 mine is consistently 8-9 hours but it cycles. Sometimes I'm awake during daytime, other times I'm awake all night."
3879,"Believe you me, it's better than not being able to sleep for 3 days straight."
3880,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 What is polyphasic sleep?
3881,
3882,@54a8f225db8155e6700e5893 Howdy!
3883,@54a8f225db8155e6700e5893 Welcome to our community
3884,Thanks!
3885,"@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 I think a consistent sleep schedule is important, but more important is sufficient sleep - 7 - 8 hours per night, not too much more or too much less"
3886,"@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 I would recommend against trying polyphasic sleep. I’ve heard horror stories about it, and I don’t think the productivity gain is worth the trade off (a fragile cycle of naps)"
3887,"The US military has definitely experimented with this a lot and here are their recommendations: Each individual nap should be long enough to provide at least 45 continuous minutes of sleep, although longer naps (2 hours) are better. In general, the shorter each individual nap is, the more frequent the naps should be (the objective remains to acquire a daily total of 8 hours of sleep)."
3888,They don’t seem to think you can sustainably sleep less with polyphasic sleep - just in shorter bursts. Which negates a lot of the upside imho
3889,Hello!

3902,@54a25226db8155e6700e3e0b thank you very much! I was confused with why 'text-align' could only be applied to blocks and not spans-
3903,"Can someone explain to me what this does?
```
event.stopPropagation
```"
3904,When an event happens such as a user clicks on an element; every element above it will also get the click. This stops that from happening.

3917,"I think bootstrap comes into play in one of the lessons @54a80ac8db8155e6700e54ff so, sure. why not?"
3918,I don't see why not. Bootstrap adds a lot to the page with little work from you. There are a lot of themes out there that can add a lot of color to your page.
3919,Ok. Thank you. I will try building my website with bootsrap.

3921,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 No prob. I didn't get bubbling until I was working with an event and didn't put that in. You'll get multiple click events with just one click!

3976,@5482651adb8155e6700dc26c Thanks!
3977,Nice looking site serhi.
3978,Thank you! I'm happy to finish my first project.
3979,Have you ever tried normalize.css?
3980,@54a80ac8db8155e6700e54ff your twitter and github links are swaped
3981,@549998fcdb8155e6700e264b good luck! it's a pretty useful certification to have. hope you enjoy it!
3982,"@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a Thanks, I will fix this."
3983,:+1:
3984,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 I tried normalize in another project. I don't really see a difference yet.
3985,i use reset by Eric Meyer
3986,"Normalize keeps some elements defaults, reset kills all the defaults.. Many professionals use normalize now. It's really nice css reset."
3987,I see. I will try and use it more then. Thank you
3988,:)
3989,It's been a while since I've checked in here *_* Finally finished the jQuery section!

3993,Thanks for checking in! @54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0
3994,So what are folks plans for their days?
3995,10 hours of coding
3996,After i wake up lol
3997,"Nope, you can’t wake up. ON TO THE PROGRAMMING EVEN IN SLEEP! :p"
3998,lol
3999,Haha
4000,I’m going to be working through the challenges and planning/structuring up a project that I’ve been pondering on for a while.
4001,"Regex, for me."
4002,@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 Sounds great! Where are you up to in the challenges?

4009,I think I deserve a little break. I will talk to you guys later.
4010,Take care.
4011,"@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 I’m technically at the devtools/jquery exercises section, but I’ve also done all the codecademy sections. Yourself?"

4014,"compared to a constant in java

4016,lol

4022,inheritance right?
4023,"@54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 same with me actually! i guess i skipped around. finished with all codecademy stuff, just caught up on the codeschool lessons"
4024,or method scope
4025,http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/  <-- free js books :)
4026,haha nice :)
4027,http://jsforcats.com/ this is cute :laughing: 
4028,I love js for cats
4029,its good for newbies
4030,hahaha
4031,"I tweeted:
  Are you new to programming?
Check out JS for Cats.. Because Meow!

4032,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 final -> can't be changed, static -> object/instance independent, class variable"
4033,Ahh
4034,I remember such terms from C# 
4035,I dislike Java lol
4036,JS for cats.. hahaha
4037,Ruby and JS  :)
4038,
4039,There need to be more cute and entertaining ways to learn programming (re: js for cats). A lot of textbooks I've used are so dry - I can see why a lot of beginners would get scared off.
4040,^
4041,Rubymonk is fun for ruby
4042,"```javascript
var status = (age >= 18) ? ""adult"" : ""minor"";
```"
4043,"Yeah, or like tryruby.org"
4044,_whys book 
4045,Chunky Bacon!!
4046,Hahaha
4047,Some beginner's Python courses can be a bit goofy sometimes too - like codecademy throws some Monty Python jokes in their exercises sometimes. But JS resources seem to be a bit dry
4048,le sigh…..the semester starts up on weds. Wish I had a few more weeks of freedom hehe
4049,"Be glad you get to go to school, many of us can't afford it :+1:"
4050,"NC State college, low income, student loans + fin aid."
4051,"I couldn't even afford that lol , I am a full time student at home learning code :P"
4052,"I am glad, I’ve just been in school for quite a while and am very eager to be done, this coming semester is my last one, so the finishing up anxiousness is strong."
4053,I can imagine.
4054,Can be really dumb question but can we use relative url with background image ?
4055,html*
4056,"background: url(""/assets/anna-bg.png"");
instead of:
background: url(""http://dash.ga.co/assets/anna-bg.png"");

but it doesnt seem to work... is it only because of the tutorial website?"
4057,It’s because it’s a tutorial website.
4058,"So if our website is made correctly, we would be able to include the image normally without everything right?
"
4059,"Correct, you would supply a relative path to the image."
4060,"Ok, thx"
4061,"Keep in mind on a normal production site you’ll be using a separate CSS file so the relative path will be from THAT css file. Often CSS and JS files will be in a static folder, and then within their own css and js folders. So you’d have to have a relative path from however you structure up your project."
4062,Just something to remember
4063,"Hey FCCers!  I started reading (and applying) the book ""Mini Habits:  Smaller Habits, Bigger Results"" to help me work through the FCC curriculum while taking care of a pretty busy life (like most everyone else on here, lol).

4092,@54a9828bdb8155e6700e5a48 Welcome to our community!
4093,@547cbe4edb8155e6700da22a I listen to audio books while I run and read off an iPad when I travel or my phone when I commute. I don’t have a regular routine around this. If a book is exciting I may get through it in a few days. Some really heavy books take me months (In which case I read other books in parallel). How about you? How do you read?
4094,@54a80ac8db8155e6700e54ff Thanks! Do you guys think this is ready to tweet out or did you see any edits/suggestions? I’m always afraid I go too into depth on things and it becomes boring.
4095,"@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c I really like audio books I am surprised how comparable the experience to reading is  without all the looking at the page and page turning. I also have a Kindle that is great to read on. The good thing about the Kindle is if you fall asleep reading you don't lose your place.
All that said I wish I found more time for reading. I tend to go in cycles where I read a lot and then times when I don't read at all.
The public library is an excellent resource for ebooks and audiobooks for FREE!"
4096,I fully endorse going to the library! (I work in a college library so yeah :P )

4101,"@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c  It's a great blog post and it just goes to show what someone is capable of when they get focused, develop consistently good habits that take regular steps to achieve their goals.  I'm having a similar experience (just beginning) with the coding, contemplative ""meditation"", and practicing tai chi (for health and physical wellbeing).  

I'd say tweet away!"
4102,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c SpeedCite is amazing. I bow before you.
4103,So is Google trying to push dev tools as a full fledged IDE? Or just a useful way to make quick changes to a site/debugging?
4104,@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 I think it's (a useful way to make quick changes to a site/debugging.)

4159,I have until summer to do something with web dev or I'm forced into finishing college
4160,@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 forced?
4161,Lol maybe too strong of a word
4162,forced by will or family?
4163,more my parents don't believe in this not going to college thing
4164,So what are you studying right nw?
4165,now*
4166,i was majoring in computer science but decided to take a break after 2 years to learn web development
4167,BS in Computer Science?
4168,Yea
4169,How are logic gates treating you?
4170,well the basics were kind of easy to follow but didn't get that far into it
4171,ill brb in a few mins
4172,okay
4173,@apexred How close are you to finishing college?
4174,50 credits or so
4175,I mean I will finish it. it would be a waste if I didn't
4176,Just want to learn web development right now full time
4177,"@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 A degree is still really important (probably for the next 10 years or so) but you’re right - once you’ve gotten a job, the degree sort of ceases to matter until it’s time to get another job"
4178,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c Yea I think I'm doing the right thing. College will always be there
4179,"I have an MBA, and it helped me get a good job, but the knowledge wasn’t all that applicable to the job itself and much of it has atrophied. I’d say I may have gotten my ~$40k investment and 2 years back, but I wouldn’t recommend grad school to anyone unless they are PhD bound and love research. But undergrad degrees are always a good bet."
4180,It also depends on the field you are going into. Sometimes the masters is more applicable to a particular field then another
4181,I've always wondered whether grad school for computer science is worth it.
4182,I'm gonna go for a BE in Software Engineering
4183,"I've got about 2 more years for BS in computer engineering. Hardest part isn't the education, it is paying for it."

4188,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c what's your academic background?

4231,@548a8c8bdb8155e6700de57a just got to organic
4232,@548a8c8bdb8155e6700de57a you?
4233,I'm a 41 year old male that got a loan so I can learn how to code within 6 months..  70 hours a week..
4234,"I'm transferring out of community college here in California US, and going to go to a University of Santa Barbara soon to finish the last 2 years of my education"
4235,We have the option to take our first two years of college in community college here in US
4236,To save some money
4237,"ah I see, that's before deciding on a major right?"
4238,No we declare a major from the start
4239,Transferring to Berkely or San Fran 
4240,yea but the first two years is a lot of general education classes
4241,I've already declared mine as a Computer Engineer but found that I like software more than hardware but I'm too far in so I can't go back now
4242,"Berkeley or San Fran would be great, Silicon Valley is the place to go for techies"
4243,Would love to go to school in cali but out state tuition is too much
4244,"@548a8c8bdb8155e6700de57a at least you're not too far off, imagine declaring a philosophy major first and then find out your passion is coding"
4245,They have hackathons often and its a great place to learn and code with other like minded people
4246,It is too much. It sucks
4247,That's too far xD
4248,"aww man, I'm jealous with all the hackathons, meetups you guys have over there"
4249,My goal this year is to move out to cali
4250,I actually don't know what's a hackathon 
4251,"Hackathon is where people gather and code anything they want basically, and in the end they present their invention no matter how ridiculous it is."
4252,FYI if there is anyone interested in banking or .net Charlotte is an amazing city for getting into web dev.
4253,(just in terms of job conversations)
4254,Its usually a three day event over the weekends
4255,Sounds fun!
4256,"@548a8c8bdb8155e6700de57a  - just saved me the time from googling it. hahaaha, thanks"
4257,happens about at least once a month in San Fran area
4258,"Bboy, do you actually break?"
4259,Yea I'm 4-5 hours away from San Fran so all I can do is read about from here but I'm like a sad child just watching from the corner not able to participate
4260,Oh yeah
4261,http://baltimorehackathon.com/
4262,just found the closest one for me hahaha
4263,"Not anymore, I created this email when I did."
4264,Lol
4265,"@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 - ""break""? what's that"

4271,It's where I got introduced to nodejs
4272,sounds like a fun time
4273,going to sleep
4274,bye
4275,good night
4276,But there is one coming up here where I live called SB Hacks. Anyone who can attend sign up we can arrange a meet.
4277,It's this month the 30th or something
4278,"```
$(function( {  return ""learn more jQuery?"" )};
```"
4279,http://www.ucsbhacks.com/
4280,"beachside hackathon, now thats sounds awesome"
4281,They probably have some in LA
4282,man I'm jealous I don't live in cali
4283,"It's expensive.
"
4284,Yea they do it in southern cali every now an then. 2 months ago it was in USC and I heard that was awesome.
4285,I’ll stick with Charlotte where it’s ridiculously cheap to live and Web dev jobs pay incredibly high compared to cost of living
4286,Woooo banks
4287,Some great apps have come out of these hackathons
4288,FCC came out of a hackathon 
4289,really @546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 ?
4290,I didn't know that
4291,Yep
4292,Goes to show the power of coding together
4293,Indeed
4294,I heard yik yak is hackathon born too. I'm not sure if that's true
4295,Thats really cool to hear
4296,"So I have a feeling the movie BlackHat was written by a nerd with grandiose dreams of being a hacker..

4297,Hello world
4298,@54a9a41cdb8155e6700e5ae8 welcome
4299,WElcome @54a9a41cdb8155e6700e5ae8!
4300,So I've come to the right placr eh? 
4301,:) 
4302,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 what are you learning atm?
4303,"Indeed, you’ve come to the right place. We are the rabid rabbit farmers LLC."
4304,Can JS object keys be strings?
4305,"Like {""Hello"": ""World""}"
4306,@5498c6a6db8155e6700e2349  I am currently going through Eloquent JS and some css courses on codeschool.
4307,Lol nice.  Basically im brand new to coding.  I have a conceptual understanind but no practical experience...  
4308,"or does it have to be like {Hello: ""World""}"
4309,"```
var myObject {
  name: ""Mark"",
  age: 41
}
```"
4310,can it be
4311,var myObj = {}
4312,"yes
"
4313,{ }
4314,That's an object literal 
4315,"""name"": ""Mark"""
4316,Like that?
4317,key: value
4318,@54a05a8adb8155e6700e37a2 you only need quotes if you have more than one word for the key
4319,OH I GET IT THANKS!!!!
4320,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 cool, I started with eloquent as well, how far are you?"
4321,"I kinda bounce around, but data structures and Objects."
4322,What about you?
4323,I'm also reading eloquent js. find it a better than the other book I read javascript for professional web developers
4324,I go back in forth lol
4325,Coderbyte sent me a $10 for a year offer? Is it worth it?
4326,"not far, 4th chapter in"
4327,you have to pay for coderbyte? lol
4328,EJS is the best book as its not dry.
4329,@5498c6a6db8155e6700e2349 no they are paying me...
4330,"I bounce from EJS codeschool, making random things, and MDN"
4331,and freecodecamp();
4332,has anyone completed all the challenges on codecamp?
4333,"Yes, we have a few people that have completed all the challenges."
4334,@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 per yesterday
4335,"nice, I'm only on challenge 11"
4336,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 you said you had 6 months to learn web developing? what do you plan on doing after that
4337,@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 1/4th in!
4338,"I am on 36, only because I jump around lol."
4339,"By then I will have 1700 hours coding, and I will apply for jobs."
4340,Maybe even sooner..
4341,Just checking in from my mobile browser
4342,front-end or back-end or both?
4343,My target is Full Stack with MEAN..  But I will take jobs as either.
4344,What's Full Stack Mean
4345,Gitter is too sloppy for mobile. I hope the app comes out soon...
4346,The MEAN stack is MongoDB  ExpressJS AngularJS and Node
4347,"Javascript front end, back end and the database."
4348,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 have you orientated on job market where you live, how is the employability there?"
4349,"Job market is good in San Diego, but there also a lot of remote jobs."
4350,are you gonna try to freelance at all?
4351,"Why cant i use this?
```
$(this).css('backgroundColor':'#252b30');
```"
4352,"I tried freelancing before it's full of people that do work for ridiculous pay, as they are from another country and Americans can't compete with that."
4353,As a best practice use addClass();
4354,also the syntax is wrong 
4355,"```
$(this).css('backgroundColor', '#252b30');
```"
4356,"needed a , not a :     :P
"
4357,yea you should use addClass. css function adds it inline
4358,What are you +54 level users doing?
4359,i see ;o
4360,But try not to change css inside of jQuery but inside of css :)
4361,"thank you guys
"
4362,"ya, im just doing the tutorial"
4363,so make a class .bg_color  then addClass('bg_color);
4364,for jq xD
4365,"```
$(this).css({backgroundColor':'#252b30'});
```

This should be valid as well."
4366,I see. That looks a lot better @546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87
4367,Ahh which tutorial?
4368,5.3 in jQuery
4369,yea its valid to pass in a object literal
4370,#12 in challenges
4371,Yea you are okay then lol
4372,So in the future to not write css in JS
4373,http://api.jquery.com/   usually will have examples and will show proper syntax
4374,It's not that it's not allowed it's just a best practice :)
4375,Mhm
4376,Keep design out of program logic.
4377,"How do I write 
```"
4378,oops
4379,As a function of user interaction JS can modify CSS.
4380,"How do i write
```
$(this).css(""background-color"", ""#252b30"");
$(this).css(""fontWeight"",""bold"");
```
without having to repeat myself?"
4381,you can abstract that css out into a class and then add the class.
4382,hello world!
4383,Hello and Welcome!
4384,@54988297db8155e6700e221d Greetings !

4388,like @trisell did above. ^ beat me to it :)
4389,thank you all :) i hope everyone's having a great day 
4390,@Nocando check the .css() docs it will usually tell you how the parameters work.
4391,@54a4588bdb8155e6700e4806 Thank You
4392,ok
4393,Yup. You can pass as many css parameters as you like in the array form above. But after 1 or two I personally think it makes more sense to just create a css class and then add and remove it as needed.
4394,"```
$(this).css({
 ""background-color"": ""#252b30"",
 ""fontWeight"": ""bold"",
 ""display"": ""none""
});
```"
4395,"multiple lines
"
4396,easier to read when adding more than 2
4397,if your gonna do that it would better to make a class imo
4398,I prefer using the braces and the colon. It just makes more sense to me in a CSS sense
4399,Yes
4400,better to do addClass(); in that case.
4401,"@piecedigital what David and Mark are getting at is that it's better to keep styling separate from code whenever possible. 1, in keeping with the MVC mindset, and 2, it's cleaner and easier to change a stylesheet once than all the places you might have made that css change in your javsascript."
4402,"```HTML
//in your stylesheet
.highlighted {
   background-color: #252b30;
   font-weight: bold;
   display: none;
}
```
```javascript

$(this).addClass('highlighted');

4420,200 will do just fine?

4422,ok thank you

4428,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c just enjoyed reading your blog post. I'm checking out Rescue Time and just downloaded Sleep Cycle. Though your twitter book reviews seem more like one sentence synopsis or summaries than positive or negative reviews.
4429,https://github.com/airbnb/javascript good read on some good style conventions for JS
4430,"although I'm doubting on the soft tab spaces, always used 4"
4431,@54a1176bdb8155e6700e39b4 You’re right - they are more like summaries than reviews. I realized that after I’d finished them and didn’t feel like redoing them. I’ll update the blog post though. Thanks!

4474,Does anyone know if the native querySelectorAll(selector) method is the same as $(selector)?
4475,"I don’t know for certain, but my guess is no. jquery does a lot of stuff in the background to normalize how it works across browsers."
4476,My guess is it’s doing extra validation in the background. (again I don’t know for certain)
4477,"Ok. I'm not obsessed with performance at this point, but I'm trying to remember that jQuery is not always called for. Thanks."
4478,no when your using $(selector) your using a jquery object
4479,"NP, keep in mind querySelectorAll(selector) works differently on browsers before IE9"
4480,there's a good stack overflow about this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11503534/jquery-vs-document-queryselectorall
4481,Right @54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 I was wondering if that particular object just used the same native method.
4482,you would have to look at the source code to be sure

4505,"@54a9cd6edb8155e6700e5b77 yes, i work at a large company doing mostly Java.  I am hoping to use JS to be able to move toward a software engineer position"

4509,@54a5c06adb8155e6700e4c52 It’s a known issue in Dash
4510,Cheers Quincy
4511,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c does it matter where you buy a domain name?
4512,@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 not godaddy! :)
4513,I was curious about what hosting site to use as well.
4514,@54a9cd6edb8155e6700e5b77 I use Dreamhost and Digital Ocean.
4515,Namecheap is one of the best for getting domains
4516,I've been very happy with mediatemple.net hosting for the past few years but they did just get acquired by godaddy
4517,ick godaddy
4518,K ill try namecheap thanks @546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8
4519,+1 for namecheap
4520,"There seems to be lots of dislike for godaddy.  :)  We use this for work emails.  I will have a look at Dreamhost and Digital Ocean, thanks @54a642e0db8155e6700e4da6 !  And, I'll also check out Namecheap, thanks @546fd99cdb8155e6700d6ec8 .  There seem to be so many, it's difficult to narrow it down."
4521,"@54a9cd6edb8155e6700e5b77 Digital Ocean is great if you want a VPS for cheap, they start at $5 a month for pretty good quality. It’s all bare bones though so all the setup is on you"
4522,Are the forums being really slow for anyone else?
4523,slower then usual or just in general? :p
4524,"@54a8c27adb8155e6700e57ff I've had the same issue.  just started this morning, so I don't know if it is just today"
4525,it’s usually pretty slow
4526,The main problem I have with godaddy is it treats everyone like it's their second day on the internet.
4527,"Ha, well as long as I'm not the only one ""suffering"""
4528,the forums seem fine to me
4529,"The reason the forum is slow is it’s a rails app, not a node app"
4530,anyone up to help out on a special project real quick? 
4531,It’s powered by Discourse. I gave it a dedicated Small AWS instance so it should be relatively fast
4532,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c what's the first language you learned?
4533,"I'm going to continue with my challenged tonight, might have a huge chunk done. not sure. "
4534,@547c3525db8155e6700d9ca7 Python. You can read all about how I learned here: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html
4535,"@QuincyLarson That was a great read!  I can absolutely relate, jumping from Ruby/RoR to Python and then JS.  I've also wasted several thousands of $$$ on Online and Offline ""coding bootcamps.""  Losing focus is very easy.  My goal now is to stick with JS and start from scratch with a new outlook, and get ready for Hack Reactor next year."
4536,"@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c  ive dabbled in python, it was what got me interested in learning programming then later on i wanted to learn web design. i still have a strong desire to learn python"

4538,Are you sure it's gone?  I just used it to log in earlier.

4546,"Anyone else experiencing difficulty with code school, It got to the point where I cut and pasted the answer and I'm still wrong and can't continue....."
4547,Which Code School challenge?
4548,@54000152163965c9bc20116f Thanks for letting me know.
4549,"@54a77922db8155e6700e531d Github auth is really messed up right now, so we pulled it."
4550,level 1 number 10

4552,@54a82769db8155e6700e556a I would say Python is worth learning if you want to program for research or statistics. It isn’t the best tool for web development.
4553,@dflan Which specific Free Code Camp challenge?
4554,(I mildly disagree with that statement re web development) @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c
4555,Challenge 10
4556,http://try.jquery.com/levels/1/challenges/10
4557,"It’s certainly not as big as say, Ruby, but it’s a segment of the industry that definitely exists. And there is definitely more need then there are developers to fill it."
4558,Granted the fields that use it the most are scientific/research/data science oriented.
4559,(and GIS!!! :P )
4560,Started freecodecamp today.  Anyone in Toronto?
4561,@54a5c06adb8155e6700e4c52 just open the sidebar and click on the next challenge.  There's an error in that specific challenge.
4562,Ive been able to get through the rest of the challenge material without issue
4563,Thanks @54a9828bdb8155e6700e5a48
4564,It would be handy if the known bugs could be added to the codecamp challenges...........

4567,@54a59d6edb8155e6700e4bba You are awesome
4568,@54a9e92cdb8155e6700e5bfd Welcome to our community!
4569,@54a5c06adb8155e6700e4c52 I got it to work. Here’s how:
4570,"```javascript
$(document).ready(function( ) {
  $(""button"").on(""click"", function(){
    var message = $(""<span>Call 1-555-jquery-air to book this tour</span>"");

    $(""button"").remove();
  });
});
```"
4571,"I think there might have been a mix up on the challenges, the only task was add <script src=""application.js""></script>"
4572,"I had the same bug, it always tells you you haven't cleared the script tag when you have"
4573,@54a9e92cdb8155e6700e5bfd Greetings and welcome to FCC!
4574,What is an endpoint?
4575,http://hackingui.com/front-end/chrome-box-shadow-bug-that-crashed-our-site/ 
4576,@54a05a8adb8155e6700e37a2 in what context?
4577,Express.js
4578,@54a05a8adb8155e6700e37a2 it’s the ending of a route
4579,like ‘/‘ or ‘/home’ or ‘/settings'
4580,so the path>
4581,in a general sense
4582,but it’s called an endpoint because you can do any number of things while it’s making its way there
4583,middleware
4584,"with express it’s really better to think of it as the terminator of a route, and a route is defined by what path it intercepts"
4585,just my opinion though
4586,Hello Everyone!  Came across FreeCodeCamp and definitely wanted to check it out!  I'm looking to just build more projects and get more stuff done and this looks like an awesome community to do so and learn at the same time.
4587,"@54a9f99adb8155e6700e5c34 welcome. You already have web development experience? If so, what’s your background?"
4588,Hello there Randy
4589,Hello @54a9f99adb8155e6700e5c34
4590,welcome @54a9f99adb8155e6700e5c34
4591,I finished a fully immersive bootcamp called MakerSquare in October and have been doing freelance stuff here and there as I work on my JavaScript so I can get a job using it everyday
4592,thanks all!
4593,Hi @54a9f99adb8155e6700e5c34
4594,"at the time the school taught ruby, rails, and js...but now they are going js only starting with the next cohort...i came out kind of knowing a little about all of them but not super strong in one so i'd like to focus strictly on the frontend and js part of web application development"
4595,Welcome @54a9f99adb8155e6700e5c34
4596,Good Morning everyone!
4597,Slept for only 5 hours! Slept at 2 AM and up on 7 AM
4598,cool I've heard of them - they operate out of austin and sf right?
4599,Still on mobile though
4600,I'll power on my laptop in an hour
4601,curious if anyone has finished all the courses on here yet and if so some feedback about the next step? I'm down to the last 4 angular exercises and looking forward to the next level!
4602,@54a2d85ddb8155e6700e41d0 correct!  i went to the one in austin
4603,cool!
4604,well i'm going to jump in and try to fly through the lessons because i want to shore up some js stuff and get going with more angular js!
4605,@54a2d85ddb8155e6700e41d0 a few people have I've heard
4606,currently on challenge 15
4607,@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 codeschool's jQuery is hard vs codecademy
4608,"i did the codecademy stuff, i'm hoping this will be more thorough"
4609,I've used jquery before so wasn't hard for me
4610,"also there seems to be more to codecademy than what is linked on their frontpage. i was gonna get into their angular stuff, but it took a backseat to finals and other stuff"
4611,@54a9f99adb8155e6700e5c34 I like your attitude!
4612,"@54a2d85ddb8155e6700e41d0 Yes, several people have finished all the FCC challenges and have also finished all the easy and medium Coderbyte challenges: http://www.freecodecamp.com/stats"
4613,Greetings!
4614,"the js console is the best place to learn jquery traversing, instant feedback"
4615,I use [hover.com](https://hover.com/) for domain registration. And Digital Ocean for hosting.
4616,on challenge #15 exercise #9 isn't the solution it shows wrong?
4617,@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 what's your issue with the solution.  i just worked on that exercise a few minutes ago
4618,http://stackoverflow.com/questions/499405/change-the-selected-value-of-a-drop-down-list-with-jquery
4619,Do I need to know AJAX to do the Express.js course? It seems to expect that as a prerequisite.
4620,"Yea I see, just seemed weird that jquery returned the whole select field instead of just the option"
4621,in the console
4622,"i understand that.  i think it happens that way because the ""selected"" field is the value that you see within the <select> element, so to set a specific one as the main value is to change the whole <select>"
4623,yea that makes sense
4624,on from laptop now
4625,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c thanks for the link to the stats! Definitely motivating.
4626,Happy New Year everyone.. 
4627,Happy New Year @54715346db8155e6700d7373
4628,Yeah...right code...didn't read the instructions...20 minutes later...yup that just happened..
4629,
4630,"Hey all. Anyone know if I can always leave off the bling on the .appendTo selector in the following code: 
```
$("".target:nth-child(2)"").clone().appendTo(""#location2"");
```
It works correctly in the jQuery exercises, but the solution includes bling on the location2 selector."
4631,there are more than one way to do it. If your solution works its fine
4632,Thanks
4633,"http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/ looks like one example of using bling on appendTo is something like $( ""h2"" ).appendTo( $( "".container"" ) ); The jquery documentation says doing it this way will  actually move the element around the DOM, instead of cloning it like in your example."
4634,@54a2d85ddb8155e6700e41d0 I agree! We’ll continue to expand the factors we track here. We believe in transparency. Nothing motivates me like seeing people around me working hard :)
4635,currently going through the stanford cs challenges. This guy is good teacher
4636,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c stats page says FCC luanched 83 days ago.
4637,I really liked the stanford CS instructor
4638,Just curious - does anyone here have any experience with coding bootcamps?
4639,hello world :) first time here
4640,@54aa17a3db8155e6700e5ca4 welcome! :cat:
4641,"Finished the code school lessons today for FCC. I think I'll probably buy a month of code school to go back through them and explore some of the other topics, but I gotta say. After that, and doing the exercises and playing around some on my own. I'm totally onboard with the JS movement."
4642,ugh functional programming in javascript is making my brain hurt
4643,Having one language across your entire project is so utterly nice. 
4644,yea can't wait to learn angular and node
4645,thank you mxys!

4647,"@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 Awesome, thanks."
4648,welcome to our community @54aa17a3db8155e6700e5ca4
4649,@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 I believe a few of our campers have done boots
4650,"I've had two close friends do boot camps, one just finished Hackerspace and another is in App Academy."
4651,@odrisck @iyeager2004 I'm considering in enrolling in one in a few months but I always hear mixed opinions on their value.
4652,which one?
4653,you guys think I should buy .com or .me domain for my personal site?
4654,I was looking at the javascript/ruby program at Epicodus
4655,"I don't actually have an opinion, I think they are of more value than college alone"
4656,I think either is good @54a64254db8155e6700e4da2
4657,@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 welcome back!
4658,@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 I have a friend who went to Epicodus.
4659,I just signed up with Free Code Camp.  Just trying this out.
4660,"@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 For a personal site, both are absolutely fine. But for businesses, clients tend to like seeing .com more"
4661,@54aa1af9db8155e6700e5ca9 welcome to FCC
4662,@54aa1af9db8155e6700e5ca9 Welcome!
4663,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c Oh cool. Did he seem to have a good experience there? I'm considering applying soon.
4664,"@54a64254db8155e6700e4da2 If you can find a .com, I’d recommend that. People tend to assume it’s a .com, so getting a non .com will make it harder for people to find your site. Also, a .com gives you a Page Rank bonus"
4665,@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 I think that Hackerspace was valuable for the friend that did it. She learned alot and has turned around and gotten a job quickly from it. She was working on school work ~90-100 hours a week.
4666,thanks for the feedback guys!
4667,"@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 He seemed to have a good time, but I found his skills to be significantly less impressive than those of my friends who went to App Academy or Hack Reactor."
4668,"@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 That may be because Epicodus is less selective to begin with. That said, if I were going to go to a bootcamp, I’d want to go to the best bootcamp I could gain admission to, and that would be App Academy or Hack Reactor."
4669,"@QuincyLarson Okay, that's good to know. Epicodus seems to get pretty good reviews but I think the price doesn't hurt. It's only a bit over $3000 for 4 months at Epicodus vs. $6000+ at some of these other bootcamps"
4670,"@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 App Academy is tough. He's working between 100 and 120 hours a week. Yeah, like 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. They have weekly assesments, fail two and you're out. It's 5 grand down, plus 18,000 grand of your precious wages after getting hired on afterwards. You're also learning Ruby, so there's that."
4671,"But if money isn't an issue, better to go for quality."
4672,"That should be 8 grand, not 18. Sorry."
4673,"Okay, I'll have to look into App Academy too."
4674,"Plus my friend in App Academy might end up flunking out, and he's a pretty sharp guy too. He said it's lots of super sharp and young CS grad types."
4675,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c So what happens when I click that button on the bottom of the FCC challenge page that says I'm done? Fireworks?
4676,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 That's a little intimidating. I don't have much of a CS background apart from a couple JavaScript courses in HS/college.
4677,"It's also tougher to get in. On the flip side, they make their money only once you get a job (i.e. it's free if you never get employed in a coding position related to the curriculum) so it's pretty much garunteed you'll get a job."
4678,"@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 Don't want to intimidate you. Plus, even if you drop out it's still free for you, you get your 5 grand back and everything."
4679,@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 I highly recommend Hack Reactor.  I have three friends who went through already.  One of them is a good friend Patrick https://twitter.com/gdi2290/ who became CTO for Keychain Logistics after HR.
4680,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 I spoke to the people at CodeSchool about hiring practices and their opinions on coding bootcamps and they emphasized that you still need to do some self-study in algorithms and CS to be a a good hire - so it's not surprising that a lot of the students at app academy should have a strong CS background
4681,"@547c3525db8155e6700d9ca7 Code, thanks. Just checked out his feed. Hack Reactor is another I'll look into."
4682,"@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 I would tend to agree. I've self-taught myself (no degree) into a position writing firmware in c/c++ and it was a lot of hard-work and luck that has helped me land the jobs I have. If I would've had a degree, it would've been cake."
4683,I'm hoping my current work experience with some portfolio work from FCC with the non-profits will help me turn this web app work into something a little easier than getting my foot in the door using self-taught C.
4684,"@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 Wow, that's quite an accomplishment! I'm not super keen on going back to get a second degree, so I'm more into the self-study/bootcamp route myself."
4685,@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 What's your current degree in?
4686,*you're... 
4687,"*your... Damn, it's getting late."
4688,nope you had it right
4689,you're is for you are :)
4690,ahh you caught it lol
4691,@54a40e99db8155e6700e46b3 Poli Sci - been working in Chinese law firms since graduating but I'm not loving it
4692,"@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0 Most of the HR people I've discussed this stuff with say they look for a four year degree, they don't care if it's CS or Sanskrit, just that you sat down for four years and toughed it out, so don't get too down."
4693,"@546fcc4cdb8155e6700d6e97 Yeah, I think my marathon of codeschool today was a bad idea. :)"
4694,lol
4695,Hey I been working on my redesign :)
4696,cool
4697,Not finished but here it is so far
4698,http://iheartkode.com/2/
4699,No bootstrap lol
4700,its responsive some :P
4701,its a very green green
4702,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 Looks great! Nice url :clap:
4703,Green ftw
4704,are my eyeballs suppose to ache on the sides? :)
4705,Colors are not final lol
4706,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 Looks good. You should have those top buttons center in the div when the width drops below 500.
4707,Thank you @54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0
4708,It supposed to
4709,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 But I'm digging the green.
4710,I have a media query for it
4711,for some reason the media query is not working :/
4712,I  started Eloquent Javascript today. This is awesome it has execises
4713,yusss
4714,It is awesome.
4715,Hmm.... Did you add --webkit and --moz cases for it?
4716,Erm no
4717,I thought media queries were good in all browsers
4718,That skyline is San Diego :P
4719,"Yeah, weird, in Chrome I'm not seeing any of your media changes taking effect when I drop the width."
4720,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 I suggest not using an image for the i<3kode logo type thing (henceforth known as logo) if you can avoid doing so. seems like it should be replicateable in the page with just text and an image/font-icon/svg for the heart. also I’d say use an svg for the logo instead of png, just cause it is resolution independent so it wont degrade on hiDPI screens"
4721,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 for the green, maybe you could try #28d079 instead"
4722,"Yea that's true, I was lazy and not very good at css yet."
4723,colors are not final lol
4724,it's the green used in this chat - pretty similar but a bit calmer
4725,Yea I need it calmer indeed thanks
4726,you havent made the social icons actual links - but it’s not done yet anyway
4727,Yea still a lot to do.
4728,28d079  yea i like that color :)
4729,btw don’t let text just get SUPER WIDE as the page expands - generally you’d want to limit it to a certain width
4730,I'm not sure how to do that without messing up the responsive part
4731,max-width
4732,@54880e02db8155e6700dd9e0  refresh
4733,Yea I wasn't sure if that would mess it up I will try 
4734,"ohh better, no eyeball ache"
4735,yea i did random green lol
4736,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 perfect! :thumbsup:
4737,yea the green is nice
4738,just did the border bottom also lol
4739,"mmm

```
@media screen and (min-width: value) {
  selector {
    max-width: value;
  }
}
```"
4740,when i do max-width: it makes the width smaller so it doesnt fill the whole width of the page
4741,to apply it just to non mobile narrowed versions - but since it’s a max-width it doesn’t matter!
4742,exactly - that’s the point
4743,but the background shrinks
4744,I need to do maxwidth to the p
4745,lol
4746,I’m not sure I follow
4747,than make the min-width larger
4748,well.. max-width to the container of the text
4749,it looks good now
4750,"you don’t actually need the media query bit when declaring a max-width, unless you have a different max-width defined for the narrower states"
4751,okay
4752,brb
4753,i changed the green section p maxwidth
4754,the brown part is borked
4755,brown?
4756,"above the green, looks brown to me"
4757,"you need to center it, the black/brown part"
4758,lol it's dark grey
4759,the text moved over left then it stayed there
4760,"I'm old, it looks brown, don't hate"
4761,the text is justified
4762,that’s not what’s causing it
4763,`margin: 0 auto;` to center
4764,the projects section is center just not the text
4765,"but you shouldn’t be applying those styles to `p`, perhaps a specific class, or a container for the text"
4766,ok
4767,unless you want the text like that. is that your intention?
4768,left aligned yes
4769,"yes the text left aligned, but still centered"
4770,"as in, in the middle of the page."
4771,not to the side
4772,i'm confused lol
4773,Been a long day lol
4774,"okay, do you know how to use the chrome (assuming you’re on chrome) developer tools?"
4775,yes
4776,can we drag attachments onto here?
4777,you can link images
4778,[![Screen Shot 2015-01-05 at 05.52.47.png](https://files.gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/HF7M/thumb/Screen-Shot-2015-01-05-at-05.52.47.png)](https://files.gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/HF7M/Screen-Shot-2015-01-05-at-05.52.47.png)
4779,oh I see
4780,:)
4781,"no no, not text-align:center. margin: 0 auto"
4782,"ah okay, haha, delayed reaction"
4783,lol
4784,Say you have margin: 0 auto;  what if i want it centered but i also want to add bottom margin with out effecting the center
4785,sure
4786,let’s learn about what the shorcut forms of certain properties
4787,"`margin: 0 auto;` is actually short for `margin: 0 auto 0 auto;`, which is short for `margin-top: 0; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left: auto;`"
4788,ok
4789,"there’s other properties that work the same way, or similarly"
4790,i could do margin left auto and margin right auto
4791,then I could have a margin-bottom:
4792,"yes, or `margin: 0 auto 10px;`"
4793,which will just be expanded to `margin: 0 auto 10px auto;`
4794,right ok
4795,This is my first hand at responsive lol
4796,still tons to learn
4797,so it starts at the top and works clockwise
4798,"no problem, I’m happy to help"
4799,I will make a heart svg and do a transparent background in css
4800,purpose?
4801,so it's scalable?
4802,I am not too concerned it works on smaller size
4803,3 hours later I have half a site lol
4804,lol
4805,I will finish it tomorrow I am tired of css for the day
4806,"According to rescue time  30 mins in google, w3c and other sites lol"
4807,25m in gitter :P
4808,haha I meant more about the transparent background
4809,oh
4810,white text on that image bg  is hard to read with out a shade of color
4811,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 I just installed Rescue Time too! Interested (and maybe scared) to see where all my online time is spent.
4812,and don’t you already have the heart? you don’t need to make it if you’ve already got it.  unless the version you have isn’t in a scalable format. I assume it was exported from a program like illustrator
4813,yes i have the svg
4814,time rescue puts me in check lol
4815,it deducts when you are on distracting sites lol
4816,my productivity for the last 3 hours was 90%
4817,I love Rescue Time!
4818,@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 I hope I don't get penalized for spending so much time in this chat...
4819,It's un categorized 
4820,I just discovered it from @546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c recent blog post and it's awesome so far.
4821,I'm back
4822,had a battery problem
4823,but this chat is not productive unless you are learning from it or a team member lol
4824,wb Ammar
4825,Ubuntu is becoming a headache now
4826,Why
4827,"@546fc6a7db8155e6700d6e87 oh I see what you mean - sure, yeah if you turn to logo into text and svg you’d want to replicate the background with dark gray and adding some transparency"
4828,I will try it see if I can get the spacing good
4829,"alright, I should’ve gone to bed a long time ago - I’ll talk to you later :) good luck"
4830,Cya thank you
4831,yea ill think ill stop on challenge 20 for  today

4834,@codeshi I've used Anki for language study but never for programming
4835,I'm really interested in diving in and using it.
4836,"Jack, in that article describes its use case and effectiveness.  I'm just curious if others have used it as well."
4837,Good Night Everyone :)
4838,I'm curious about how much hour do you learn to code a day while working full-time job?
4839,"@54000152163965c9bc20116f I try to get in 2 hours a night, after my kids are to bed. On good nights when the planets align and all is well, I get 3-4 hours in."
4840,Whatever time you can get. Some do 20hours a week.

4851,@546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c i guess i was not on the main google page but i followed this link

4862,Hello Hello - welcome all!
4863,@547c3525db8155e6700d9ca7 Anki is good. And free. It's a little unpolished but it gets the job done.
4864,Just finished [Make it Stick](http://makeitstick.net/) Thinking about what would be the best way to apply it to learning programming.
4865,"I'm glad to hear that, thanks for the input."
4866,Ah... I remember that book!
4867,And it's [Make it Stick](http://makeitstick.net/) not [Made to Stick](http://heathbrothers.com/books/made-to-stick/) :) got mixed up on that yesterday... Both seem like good books.
4868,Good Night FCC!
4869,Good night and thanks for the book recommendations!
4870,"Good night. I'm going to sleep as well, see you guys tomorrow!  "

4927,nice. have you seen that Mean.js blog generator ?
4928,I am not yet good enough with JS do that

4938,Idk. Maybe just too many bad experience with marketing schemes. Maybe just too lazy/ ADHD

4955,How do I go about on building a portfolio?
4956,Can i use a portfolio pieces from codepen? or idk what else
4957,"Hi all, Im Jason and Im a graphic/web designer wanting to learn javascript. First of all Happy New Year everyone!"

4961,@54a60826db8155e6700e4d3e hahaha
4962,@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9  i don't have any real answer for you on resources for building your portfolio; I was just being silly if that was unclear.
4963,i knew you were being silly xD
4964,"@54a4faaedb8155e6700e49c9 
Here are some portfolios for inspiration:

4987,@5498c6a6db8155e6700e2349  are you more interested in back end?

4989,"@54a60826db8155e6700e4d3e haha, I am not mackenzie"
4990,"ah ok im still sorting it all out, but Im fairly sure design is not my thing, so trying to understand what the options are"
4991,I watched this video yesterday that was referenced on reddit.  [Web Development Career advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXqs6X0lzKI&list=PLoem0-yXMB1B8unY9xunkTFxYR3hWp8zb)
4992,">capslock title
>seems legit"
4993,So I'm guessing if I'm not interested in design...then focusing on node or ruby and database etc is the way to go
4994,"well, what are you interested in"
4995,process of elimination in this niche is a strange career deciding method
4996,ah maybe true
4997,i feel steered by several things other than what i'm interested in
4998,I take it back-- like the video although I think it might be overwhelming to people coming into the field though...

I'm seeing the RSVPs ticking up past 300 so it's time to   state the obvious caveats :-)

Our venue is meant to hold about half that number. More importantly, we are budgeting for food/drinks for about 150-175 people.

We have tried to micro-manage RSVPs in the past and always found that we'd have open seats & no-shows (while people who really wanted to be there were waitlisted) - however when we let this play out, it seems to work out best since those who *can* make it, often do arrive early.

Please be aware that venue seating, food/drink & swag will be on a first-come-first served basis. When we reach capacity, we will try to post a comment to this space to let you know but in general we find we reach full capacity by 7pm. 

Other than that, we look forward to seeing you all one last time before 2018, and wish everyone in this community a happy & productive New Year in advance.",,

All ticketed attendees will be invited into a Slack channel to start pre-event discussions/team-formation etc.

The reality is that most presentations were prepared beforehand and presented with a request for questions.  The actual conference sharply deviated from the proposed venue where a group of people participate equally in finding solutions to difficult issues.  The structured presentations that were  given provided less value than I expected.

As a value proposition, bang for time invested, I rate this conference very low. I would not recommend this event to other CEOs with limited time trying to get traction.  Their time is better spent in the trenches.",,

1. 
The regular event begins at 6pm but doors will be open from 4pm onwards for anyone who wants to arrive early and work on codelabs. Bring your own laptop to use for this.

2. 
We accepted a number of ""lightning talks"" from community members to kick this off. Please note that each speaker here will have only 5 mins for their segment -- if you would like to do a longer talk, come speak to an organizer. We do plan to do follow-up ""deep-dive"" events into specific technologies and would be happy to schedule the longer talk there.


Finally, are trying to work around the continuing no-show problem by increasing the number of confirmed RSVPs but note that we do have a fixed venue capacity so we hope to accommodate people until all seats are filled. We give priority to regular attendees and first-timers so do remember to ""check-in"" your attendance with Lakshma when you arrive.",,

I have a presentation here 

http://tinyurl.com/y7wadltv

that explains how Chrome begat V8, and V8 begat Node and Node begat Express and then how Google said let there be Actions! It includes links to testing tools and a bare-bones code sample.

Note that it strays from the well-trodden - and Prisoner-approved :-)  - path of using a ""serverless"" deployment and Dialog Flow for the NLU in favor of a plain vanilla Node/Express combo. 

Mostly that is because it is so simple a sample it doesn't try to understand language but merely repeats it and it was never intended to be deployed. Still, it may not be a bad place to start learning how to build an Action. Or not.

I didn't immediately see the connection to html5, but it was a good window into how creating web applications is evolving.

One question for any of the speakers, I guess Colt in particular is, what do you see as the drawbacks for serverless architecture? I mean, it sure seems you are relying a lot on 3rd parties, which granted, are probably just as, or more reliable than your own architecture, but still, it seems a bit tenuous. You don't want yer ship to fall apart, after all. ;)

I sort of have the same question with Firebase, though did get a better feel that the tradeoff for outsourcing security and stability is a little less flexibility (at least how I understood it).",,

I didn't immediately see the connection to html5, but it was a good window into how creating web applications is evolving.

One question for any of the speakers, I guess Colt in particular is, what do you see as the drawbacks for serverless architecture? I mean, it sure seems you are relying a lot on 3rd parties, which granted, are probably just as, or more reliable than your own architecture, but still, it seems a bit tenuous. You don't want yer ship to fall apart, after all. ;)

I sort of have the same question with Firebase, though did get a better feel that the tradeoff for outsourcing security and stability is a little less flexibility (at least how I understood it).",,

The ""Prisoner approved"" deployment method is ""whatever you are familiar with"". Unlike other platforms (ahem) which STRONGLY encourage you to use their serverless platform, Google really does let you run anywhere in whatever language you're familiar with.

They have some additional support if you're using node.js in either their environment, or with express.js (which their environment uses behind the scenes)... but if you want to use Java on your personal server, .NET on Azure, or whatever you want on AWS... go for it!

We are a young, engaged and fast-growing meetup. We are trying to scale and bring on more people as we grow.  I am hugely committed to transparency - we try to be up front about how & why we do things.

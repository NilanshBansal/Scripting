2993,"instead they recommend interleaved learning, tackling multiple different topics and having them interspersed.

3000,So as I try to scalp the tl;dr version of the book from you :P,negative,unpredcitable
3001,The idea is to self-question and review as you go through a tutorial rather than simply filling in answers and moving on?,negative,Q
3002,"I guess the problem is that you want to move through the material quickly and spending a lot of time reviewing seems like it takes twice as long. I guess if the point is actually learning the material rather than completing the tutorials it's worth the extra time.

The other problem is that a lot of material ""is organised with one chapter for one topic and then the next chapter on another topic""...",,
3003,And the way to combat that would be more review while tying in other learned material I imagine,neutral,unpredcitable
3004,"Another thing I noticed about completing online tutorials. I get kind of hooked on the sense of completion. If I'm moving quickly through a course I feel I'm crushing it etc.. But there is no point in completing something if you don't absorb it. An example is the complete web dev course. I'm at the end of the Jquery section completing the code player task. At the outset of the video Rob says to have a go at the project on your own before watching the video. I had a go got half way through just styling it and got really stuck. I think old me would have watched the video, felt I actually did know a lot of what he does and then move on excited to get stuck into the Bootstrap section. But now I'm going to see how he does it and then attempt it again without watching his video. And keep doing it until I can do the whole thing on my own without referring to his video at all. Otherwise whats the point? ",,

I fall into this trap. For example I want to complete the Treehouse tracks. I do  work through and type everything out. I guess I should spend more time on the extra credit steps.

My problem is and remains to be not being able to stick to one thing long enough to master it. I started with Python, moved to PHP, then to JavaScript, and now back to PHP. ",,

GNU/Linux is an operating system by itself, but it's about as much of a blank slate of an operating system as you can get. So there exist distributions of Linux. They take that blank slate and add things people will probably find useful. Each of them have different opinions about how things should be done, which software should come preinstalled, which software to make available through their official package manager on their official repository (which will involve making decisions about which type of software (eg. open source, binary blobs) they want to support). Each of these is put together by different people, so it's not like a different version of Windows, which will still be put together by Microsoft.
